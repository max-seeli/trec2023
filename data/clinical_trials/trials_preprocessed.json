The proposed study will investigate the role of various tests in improving\r\n      detection of disease progression in advanced glaucoma. Evaluation of the peripheral field of\r\n      vision (visual field examination) remains the current standard for detection of progression\r\n      in glaucoma. However, there is a lot of variability or inconsistency in eyes with advanced\r\n      glaucoma, which could make it difficult to detect worsening of glaucoma with visual fields.\r\n      The optic nerve demonstrates significant damage in such eyes and hence oftentimes repeat\r\n      imaging of the optic nerve head is not helpful for detection of change. Therefore, imaging of\r\n      the central retina (the innermost sensitive tissue lining the inside of the eye), called\r\n      macula, has been proposed to supplant imaging of the nerve in eyes with severe glaucoma. The\r\n      macula aids in detailed central vision. Since the macular retinal neural cells are the last\r\n      ones to be affected in glaucoma, measurement of macular retinal thickness could provide\r\n      significant information with regard to the course of glaucoma. In the proposed study,\r\n      glaucoma patients will be tested and followed with various measurements done with newer\r\n      versions of optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and visual field machines. The\r\n      patients will undergo repeat imaging and visual field testing every 6 months over the course\r\n      of 5 years. Rates of change will be estimated. We will explore if changes in various outcome\r\n      measures derived from imaging are correlated with the corresponding visual field changes in\r\n      glaucoma, and whether the former can be used as an alternative method for detecting\r\n      simultaneous or subsequent glaucoma progression. The hypothesis for this proposed research is\r\n      that macular OCT parameters are valid structural measures that can be used especially in\r\n      advanced disease to follow the course of glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Glaucoma is a major public health issue worldwide and manifests clinically as a chronic\r\n      progressive optic neuropathy with concomitant visual field (VF) loss. Glaucoma can cause\r\n      significant visual disability and decreased quality of life (1). Based on WHO's report in\r\n      2002, glaucoma is the second cause of blindness. The key to prevention of visual loss from\r\n      glaucoma is early detection of the disease or its progression and timely treatment. Glaucoma\r\n      can be quite advanced at the time of initial detection. The prevalence of advanced glaucoma\r\n      at the time of diagnosis varies but can be quite high. For example, the average VF mean\r\n      deviation (MD) in patients diagnosed with glaucoma in the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study was\r\n      -9.6 dB (2), which represents moderately advanced to severe glaucoma. Detection of\r\n      progression in advanced stages of glaucoma continues to be challenging. Visual field\r\n      examination remains the gold standard for detection of progression in advanced glaucoma.\r\n      However, long-term VF variability or noise in such eyes is significant, which could confound\r\n      detection of change. The optic nerve head and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)\r\n      demonstrate significant damage in such eyes and hence are not helpful for detection of\r\n      change. About 50% of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are located within 4-5 mm of the macular\r\n      center (3). Since the macular RGCs are the last ones to be affected in glaucoma, measurement\r\n      of macular retinal thickness or retinal sublayers could provide significant information with\r\n      regard to the course of advanced glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      The macular retinal sublayers can now be measured with reasonable accuracy with SD- OCTs.\r\n      There is some evidence that measurement of the macular ganglion cell complex (GCC, combined\r\n      thickness of RNFL, RGC and inner plexiform layer or IPL), or macular retinal thickness or\r\n      volume may detect early glaucoma with a performance that approximates that of circumpapillary\r\n      RNFL thickness measurements (4,5). In addition, such macular measurements have proved to be\r\n      very reproducible (4,6). Given this excellent reproducibility, macular outcome measures would\r\n      be the main candidates for following glaucoma eyes with advanced damage, in which the macular\r\n      region is essentially the only retinal area with residual RGCs.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01791673", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["open-angle_glaucoma", "pseudo-exfoliative_glaucoma", "pigmentary_glaucoma", "filtering_glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["ocular_or_retrobulbar_tumor", "retinal_detachment", "choroidal_hemorrhage", "ocular_infectious_diseasee"], "brief_title": "Circular Cyclocoagulation Using HIFU With EYEOP1 Device in Glaucoma Patients", "brief_summary": "\n      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of the cyclocoagulation\r\n      using HIFU in glaucoma patients\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT03151577", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": [], "exclusion": ["end-stage_glaucoma"], "brief_title": "Longitudinal Study on Glaucoma Surgery Using XEN\u00ae Gel Stent", "brief_summary": "\n      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the XEN\u00ae Gel Stent in mild to moderate glaucoma\r\n      patients undergoing glaucoma surgery.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the XEN\u00ae Gel Stent in mild to moderate glaucoma\r\n      patients undergoing glaucoma surgery.\r\n\r\n      Follow-up period is 2 years.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01293474", "minimum_age": 50.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["poag"], "exclusion": ["optic_nerve_disorder", "retinal_vascular_disorder"], "brief_title": "Choroidal Thickness in Glaucoma Patients and Healthy Controls", "brief_summary": "\n      With the new software tool (EDI, enhanced depth imaging) of the Spectralis\u00ae spectral-domain\r\n      optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) it is possible to visualize and measure the choroidal\r\n      thickness.

A critical\r\n      barrier to preventing vision loss is that about one-half of glaucoma patients are essentially\r\n      \"untreated\" because they do not adhere to their medications. Ineffective self-management\r\n      behaviors and poor clinical outcomes disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of\r\n      US society. The increased burden of glaucoma due to an aging US population, together with a\r\n      projected shortage of ophthalmologists, will make team-based care essential. There is a\r\n      critical need to develop and test team-based, personalized behavior change interventions for\r\n      glaucoma patients to improve medication adherence and the outcomes of care.\r\n\r\n      Poor adherence to effective medications is a critical barrier to better outcomes in glaucoma\r\n      patients. The World Health Organization stated that \"increasing the effectiveness of\r\n      adherence interventions may have a far greater impact on the health of the population than\r\n      any improvement in specific medical treatments.\" Once diagnosed with glaucoma, at least half\r\n      of patients do not adhere to their glaucoma medication regimen, return for follow-up, or\r\n      persist with their medications over the longer term. Patients who are not adherent have more\r\n      severe visual field loss, which leads to steep declines in health-related quality of life and\r\n      increased risk of falls and motor vehicle accidents.\r\n\r\n      Adherence to glaucoma medications is rarely addressed during the clinical encounter because\r\n      education and counseling programs are not part of standard glaucoma care. Focus groups have\r\n      demonstrated that patients often have a poor understanding of glaucoma and its treatment. In\r\n      addition to knowledge gaps, patients have numerous concrete and psychological barriers to\r\n      managing their glaucoma. In addition, eye drop instillation is rarely taught, and many\r\n      patients cannot properly instill their medications.\r\n\r\n      Uniform, scripted approaches to improve adherence do not work. However, complex,\r\n      individualized counseling interventions, especially those based in motivational interviewing\r\n      (MI), have improved adherence and health outcomes in many chronic diseases. MI is a style of\r\n      counseling that engages patients by discussing priorities and obstacles to facilitate\r\n      intrinsic motivation to change health behavior. Few complex interventions based on these\r\n      successful principles have been rigorously tested and none implemented into glaucoma care.\r\n      The eyeGuide is a web-based personally tailored behavior change program based on MI\r\n      principles, a systematic review of the glaucoma adherence literature, and data from focus\r\n      groups, surveys and iterative beta-testing with glaucoma patients. It provides individually\r\n      tailored disease information and support to facilitate MI-based conversations between\r\n      patients and paraprofessional staff to improve medication adherence. Such technology-based\r\n      electronic health (eHealth) innovations have great potential to extend the reach of\r\n      physicians by enabling team-based care.\r\n\r\n      In this pilot study, the study will test the impact of two personalized eHealth technologies\r\n      on medication adherence among non-adherent glaucoma patients in a pre-post design: 1) real\r\n      time automated adherence reminders; and 2) the eyeGuide counseling program.

We also will attempt to establish, through proven methodologies of tissue\r\n      gene expression, that the source of these differences in markers, notably PEDF and IL-18, is\r\n      from the uveal tissues of the anterior chamber, most importantly the iris and possibly the\r\n      trabecular meshwork as well.\r\n\r\n      The actual etiology at the cellular level of elevated intraocular pressure and the\r\n      development of pigmentary glaucoma is not well understood in humans. If anterior chamber\r\n      immune dysfunction were shown to be an important factor in the development of this disease in\r\n      humans, which apparently is demonstrated by the DBA/2J mouse, it would lead to an important\r\n      area of further investigation and possible novel approaches in treating or preventing this\r\n      disease in humans.\r\n\r\n      We hypothesize that in patients with pigmentary glaucoma, the amount of PEDF in the aqueous\r\n      is significantly reduced while IL-18 is significantly elevated when compared to the aqueous\r\n      of normal controls. In patients with POAG, we hypothesize similar results for PEDF, although\r\n      significantly less reduction of PEDF when compared to the pigmentary glaucoma patients may be\r\n      an interesting finding as well. With regard to IL-18, it is possible that amounts would be\r\n      significantly elevated in the pigmentary glaucoma patients when compared to both normal\r\n      controls and POAG patients. In view of the results from the DBA/2J mouse model, we hope to\r\n      determine whether expression of PEDF could be down regulated in the iris and/or trabecular\r\n      meshwork of pigmentary glaucoma patients when compared to POAG patients and whether IL-18\r\n      expression in these tissues could be up regulated in pigmentary glaucoma patients when\r\n      compared to POAG patients.\r\n\r\n      Such findings would strongly suggest that anterior chamber immune abnormalities play a role\r\n      in the etiology of pigmentary glaucoma in humans.

In glaucoma, vision is lost\r\n      through apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on a\r\n      combination of progressive, characteristic vision loss (measured using visual field testing)\r\n      and progressive optic nerve head damage (as detected through dilated fundus examinations or\r\n      optic disc photography). While ocular hypertension (OHT) is not sufficient for a diagnosis of\r\n      glaucoma, it is the greatest prognostic and modifiable factor. In fact, the only effective\r\n      treatment for glaucoma currently is to treat the elevated IOP. This treatment does not\r\n      provide a cure but it does slow glaucoma progression. IOP is determined by the balance\r\n      between aqueous production (flow) and aqueous humor outflow through either the trabecular\r\n      meshwork or uveoscleral pathway. Therefore, all clinically available glaucoma treatments are\r\n      designed to increase drainage and/or reduce production. The main purpose of the current study\r\n      is the determination of aqueous humor dynamics.\r\n\r\n      There are two main types of glaucoma, \"open angle\" or chronic glaucoma and \"closed angle\" or\r\n      acute glaucoma. Open angle glaucoma tends to progress slowly and may remain undetected until\r\n      the patient notices a change in vision. On the other hand, angle closure glaucoma appears\r\n      suddenly and can be very painful, therefore is often diagnosed more quickly. The chance of\r\n      suffering from either one of these types of glaucoma depends greatly on one's ethnic\r\n      background. People suffering from primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) have short axial\r\n      lengths and shallow anterior chambers. These physical dimensions are found predominantly in\r\n      people from Asia and India. Angle-closure glaucoma is caused by factors that either pull or\r\n      push the iris up into the angle, physically blocking the drainage of aqueous humor and\r\n      increasing the resistance to outflow. The IOP will increase to dangerous levels in order to\r\n      drain the fluid through the obstructed outflow pathways.\r\n\r\n      Narrow angles are not present in children. As a person ages, the lens of the eye continues to\r\n      grow. In some but not all people, this growth pushes the iris forward, narrowing the angle.\r\n      Risk factors for developing narrow angles include Asian ethnicity, hyperopia, family history,\r\n      and advanced age. Prevalence figures identify East Asia as home to the majority of those\r\n      affected by PACG. PACG is acknowledged as a major cause of ocular morbidity in Chinese\r\n      populations and is more common among Chinese people than among Caucasian people. Part of the\r\n      global project is to travel to China to study Chinese children and adults. This will be done\r\n      in collaboration with Ganzu Hospital in Lanzhou, China. This is not part of the current\r\n      protocol.\r\n\r\n      Open angle glaucoma typically occurs in older patients in the sixth decade of life or more.\r\n      African-Americans have up to six times higher risk of developing the condition than the\r\n      general population especially if there is a family history of glaucoma. Additionally,\r\n      patients who are highly myopic, have diabetes mellitus, or have cardiovascular problems are\r\n      at high risk of developing open angle glaucoma. Visual acuity, axial length and medical\r\n      history will be collected as part of the current protocol.\r\n\r\n      Unlike narrow angle glaucoma, patients with open angle glaucoma have a gradual blockage of\r\n      aqueous humor outflow despite a seemingly open chamber angle in the drainage pathway. As the\r\n      eye ages, the drainage system can become clogged with debris causing pressure inside the eye\r\n      to build to harmful levels. Open angle glaucoma can develop gradually and remain undetected\r\n      for years. Because there is usually no pain experienced over the months or years of\r\n      development and no other symptoms are apparent, the patient is often unaware of the existence\r\n      of this serious eye disorder. Since African-Americans are at such a high risk for contracting\r\n      glaucoma, children and adults of this ethnic background will be included in this study.\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma can occur in children as well as adults. Glaucoma that begins before the child is 3\r\n      years old is called infantile or congenital glaucoma. Glaucoma manifesting itself in a\r\n      child's teens is juvenile glaucoma. There are many causes of childhood glaucoma, such as\r\n      heredity, or injury or certain eye disorders. Once the investigators collect information on\r\n      aqueous humor dynamics in healthy teenaged children, the investigators will study children of\r\n      the same age with glaucoma. The investigators are planning to conduct these studies at\r\n      Paracelsus University in Salzburg Austria. That is not part of the present protocol.\r\n\r\n      In the recent rabbit study, the investigators have learned that there are distinctive\r\n      circadian rhythms of IOP and aqueous humor dynamics in juvenile and adult rabbits. In the\r\n      ongoing clinical study of ocular hypertensive patients, the investigators are finding that\r\n      some glaucoma medications are not effective at night despite being efficacious during the\r\n      day. This has significant clinical importance. The investigators are including the study of\r\n      aqueous humor dynamics at night in the current protocol to determine the normal circadian\r\n      patterns for each ethnic group and age group.\r\n\r\n      In animal studies, the investigators have found that there are several significant\r\n      differences in aqueous humor dynamics in immature animals compared to adult animals. This is\r\n      not just a continuum of changes occurring between young and old adults. The investigators\r\n      predict that important changes also take place in the ocular fluid dynamics of the eye as a\r\n      child matures. The major changes may occur during puberty. Understanding normal ocular\r\n      physiology in children will help us to understand the pathological changes taking place in\r\n      juvenile glaucoma.

Tube shunt devices\r\n      are designed to drain eye fluid (aqueous humor) through a tube inserted into the front\r\n      chamber of the eye (anterior chamber) to a plate secured to the mid-posterior section of the\r\n      outer eyeball wall. The body then lays down collagen tissue and forms a capsule around the\r\n      plate. The fluid filters through the capsule of collagen tissue and is reabsorbed into the\r\n      ocular and systemic circulation. The collagen tissue continues to remodel itself over a long\r\n      period of time (up to years). However, a well characterized, yet poorly understood,\r\n      phenomenon occurs in many patients in the 4-8 weeks after the device's implantation, called\r\n      the hypertensive phase. The pressure of the eye can increase from a desirable level of about\r\n      10 immediately after the tube shunt implantation to much higher levels, in the range of 20 to\r\n      30's, and then it may gradually return to less than 20. Such a high pressure phase can cause\r\n      irreversible damage an eye with glaucoma. The usual management of a high pressure phase is to\r\n      start glaucoma medications as soon as it is detected. A previous study we conducted showed\r\n      that this high pressure phase resolves in about half of patients with medical therapy, but\r\n      the other half may continue to have higher than expected pressures. The exact cause of this\r\n      high pressure phase is unknown. However, it is postulated that the mechanism may involve a\r\n      compaction collagen tissue layers under the eye's own fluid pressure while the collagen\r\n      tissue is being laid down, which in turn creates a firm, dense capsule that makes escape of\r\n      fluid difficult. Therefore, it is argued that if the formation of eye fluid is reduced by\r\n      medication during this initial period when the collagen tissue is laid down, the compaction\r\n      of collagen, and subsequently the high pressure phase may be avoided.\r\n\r\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the occurrence rate of the high pressure phase and\r\n      the final pressure outcomes between patients treated with glaucoma medication prior to the\r\n      expected onset of the high pressure phase to those patients who have glaucoma medication\r\n      started at the onset of the high pressure phase.

If it is true that the rate and pressure level of the hypertensive\r\n      phase can be reduced by simply starting glaucoma medications to reduce the formation of eye\r\n      fluid before the expected the high pressure phase begins, which is generally 4 weeks after\r\n      implantation of the tube shunt device, glaucoma patients can be saved from exposure to the\r\n      very high level of eye pressure, and the eventual pressure control may be better.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01338467", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open_angle_glaucoma", "pseudo-exfoliative_glaucoma", "pigmentary_glaucoma", "ocular_hypertension", "hg"], "exclusion": ["glaucoma", "ocular_or_retrobulbar_tumor", "retinal_detachment", "choroidal_hemorrhage", "detachment", "ocular_infectious_disease"], "brief_title": "Glaucoma Treatment by Circular Cyclocoagulation Using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound With the EYEOP Medical Device", "brief_summary": "\n      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of the EYEOP treatment\r\n      using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound in refractory glaucoma patients.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT02659709", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucoma"], "exclusion": [], "brief_title": "Interest in Electronic Applications for Patients With Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      To evaluation interest in use of smartphone- and tablet-based application (app) for\r\n      participants with glaucoma, ocular hypertension, those at risk and their caregivers.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      This study is designed to determine the amount of interest in an educational application\r\n      (app) on social media for glaucoma patients and their caregivers.\r\n\r\n      The purpose of this App is to enhance understanding of glaucoma by using short video\r\n      tutorials.

Secondary Pediatric\r\n      glaucoma includes a variety of ocular conditions that lead to high intraocular pressure (IOP)\r\n      and progressive optic neuropathy. Glaucoma is a well-known complication of congenital\r\n      cataract extraction and is the most frequent long-term complication of lensectomy with or\r\n      without intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. The reported incidence in the literature is\r\n      between 15% and 45%4. Another cause is aphakic glaucoma.Management of secondary pediatric\r\n      glaucoma is mainly surgical, and medical therapy is used either as a temporizing measure or\r\n      as an adjunctive treatment.\r\n\r\n      Traditionally, \"staged approach\" has been favored by many ophthalmologists. This involves\r\n      starting with angle surgeries and their repetition in the case of failure, proceeding with\r\n      trabeculectomy or combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy for refractory patients, and drainage\r\n      device or cyclodestruction for very advanced patients.The poor clinical outcomes prompted\r\n      surgeons to adapt glaucoma drainage devices (GDDs) as a mainstay of treatment for refractory\r\n      glaucoma in both pediatric and adult populations.In children, Ahmed glaucoma valves (AGV)\r\n      have greater than 80% success rate at 1- year, but success decreases to less than 50% by 5\r\n      years2. In order to improve long-term IOP control, mitomycinC (MMC) has been used as an\r\n      adjuvant during implant placement. While MMC is a commonplace in trabeculectomy, its use with\r\n      GDDs is controversial due to increased complications such as bleb leaks and endothelial cell\r\n      damage. More recently, Ologen, a biodegradable Type-I collagen matrix, has been used in\r\n      glaucoma surgeries.

In\r\n      Ghana, the prevalence of open-angle glaucoma over age 40 is 8.5%. In Barbados, the prevalence\r\n      is 7.0%. In neighboring St. Lucia, the prevalence has been estimated at 8.8% with a 16%\r\n      ten-year incidence of glaucoma-related blindness in one or both eyes. (In contrast, the\r\n      prevalence in US adults is 1.9%.) The burden of glaucoma-related visual dysfunction is also\r\n      substantial in the developing world. Because the application of medical and surgical\r\n      therapies is limited by issues such as cost, availability, and limited regional surgical\r\n      expertise, undertreatment is pervasive. Also, there is little access to low vision or vision\r\n      rehabilitation services and minimal social support for the visually impaired. Laser\r\n      trabeculoplasty may be a part of the solution to the developing world's burgeoning glaucoma\r\n      burden. The treatment is fast, safe, minimally invasive and requires minimal post-treatment\r\n      care; the equipment is portable; and the incremental cost of trabeculoplasty treatment is\r\n      small once the equipment and expertise are on-site. Our recent study in St. Lucia\r\n      demonstrated that laser trabeculoplasty lowers IOP by an amount likely to favorably alter the\r\n      clinical course of glaucoma (versus no treatment) and has the potential to bend the\r\n      glaucoma-related blindness curve in the African-derived developing world. Our long-term goal\r\n      is to translate this finding through a public health initiative by establishing a\r\n      pan-Caribbean glaucoma laser program to provide safe, effective, and cost-effective therapy\r\n      for glaucoma in this underserved and overburdened region. Before this can happen, several\r\n      important research questions remain unanswered regarding SLT in this population and comprise\r\n      the specific aims of this proposal. What is the long-term efficacy of SLT in this population?\r\n      Is repeat SLT effective once the IOP reduction of initial SLT wanes? Are the results obtained\r\n      in St. Lucia generalizable to other developing nations populated by people of African\r\n      descent? In this application, we propose a prospective cohort study in St. Lucia in which\r\n      qualifying subjects with open-angle glaucoma will receive bilateral selective laser\r\n      trabeculoplasty, will be followed to failure of initial SLT, and will undergo repeat SLT and\r\n      again be followed to failure. The long-term safety and efficacy of both initial and repeat\r\n      SLT in glaucoma patients of African descent will thus be established. Further, we will\r\n      replicate the cohort study in Dominica to confirm external validity of the St. Lucia\r\n      outcomes.

Telemedicine screenings occur all over the state of NJ at\r\n      community centers, schools, places of worship, soup kitchens, other.\r\n\r\n      Telemedicine system component assembly: Integration to imaging equipment, setup,\r\n      installation, and training of personnel will be performed.\r\n\r\n      In summary, this phase includes setup of imaging equipment (anterior segment and fundus\r\n      camera) to the system, training of personnel, and post-installation quality checks by a\r\n      communication technology expert. The server and specialized software will be customized for\r\n      data entry, storage and display of selected patient health data in a secure configuration for\r\n      internet access. Data obtained during routine IOVS telemedicine outreach program screening\r\n      including demographic data, medical and ocular history, comprehensive ocular screening data\r\n      (including imaging of the anterior and posterior ocular segments) will be configured for real\r\n      time remote access by a physician.

Virtual\r\n      storage of data will be configured, and monitors with visualization technology applications\r\n      will be installed to communicate with the imaging devices used in telemedicine.\r\n\r\n      During this phase quality measures will be tracked, recorded and analyzed.

Participant patients will go\r\n      through the consent process. All questions about the study will be explained by\r\n      investigators. Upon consent process completion the participant will first undergo testing\r\n      through the telemedicine protocol (see below). Data and images will then be transmitted. The\r\n      investigator physician evaluating teleglaucoma data will assess the patient data and a\r\n      diagnosis, management and follow-up recommendation will be made. The participant subject will\r\n      then proceed to glaucoma clinic, where the participant will be examined by the investigator\r\n      physician in the glaucoma clinic according to standard of care practices. The investigator\r\n      physician physically present in the glaucoma clinics and the investigator physician in the\r\n      teleglaucoma reading room will be masked to each other's recommendations regarding diagnostic\r\n      tests and therapeutic recommendations.\r\n\r\n      Data regarding the accuracy of diagnostic tests (e.g., visual acuity, tonometry, optic nerve\r\n      assessment, and other routine glaucoma tests) from teleglaucoma and from physical presence\r\n      will be compared. The accuracy of glaucoma diagnosis (no glaucoma, glaucoma suspect,\r\n      confirmed Glaucoma) and management recommendations will also be compared. Parameters to be\r\n      studied will include comparisons of LogMAR visual acuity, tonometry, ocular examination and\r\n      particularly optic nerve evaluation (estimation of vertical and horizontal cup-to-disc ratio,\r\n      presence of signs of glaucomatous neuropathy: disc hemorrhage, notching, localized pallor,\r\n      and asymmetry in cup-to-disc ratio of the two eyes >0.2 disc diameters, among others).\r\n      Limitations to an adequate ocular examination or imaging during teleglaucoma and physical\r\n      presence will be tracked. Inter-observer agreement between the two arms (teleglaucoma and\r\n      physical presence) will be determined.\r\n\r\n      The accuracy of glaucoma diagnosis, i.e., confirmed glaucoma, glaucoma suspect, no glaucoma,\r\n      as well as management recommendations, i.e., monitoring care, therapeutic interventions,\r\n      obtained via teleglaucoma and physical presence will be compared. Statistical analyses will\r\n      be performed on collected data. All data will be collected by subject codes. No protected\r\n      health information will be gathered.

This damage affects all visual pathways up to the visual center in the\r\n      brain.\r\n\r\n      Although increased intraocular pressure is considered the most important modifiable risk\r\n      factor in glaucoma, many factors play a role in its pathogenesis and progression.\r\n\r\n      Different classifications have been proposed for various types of glaucoma. Accordingly,\r\n      glaucoma;\r\n\r\n        -  Open angle or closed angle depending on the iridocorneal angle,\r\n\r\n        -  Primary or secondary, depending on the presence of etiological factors that may cause\r\n           increased intraocular pressure,\r\n\r\n        -  According to the age of onset of glaucoma, it can be classified as congenital, childhood\r\n           or adult glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      In general, POAG is the most common type of glaucoma, accounting for 60-70% of cases. This is\r\n      followed by secondary glaucomas (30%), primary angle-closure glaucomas (12%) and congenital\r\n      glaucomas (3%).\r\n\r\n      POAG, also known as simple chronic glaucoma, is a disease with elevated intraocular pressure,\r\n      cupping at the optic nerve head, and loss of visual field.\r\n\r\n      POAG is an insidious onset, progressive, bilateral anterior optic neuropathy. One of the\r\n      features that distinguishes it from other types of glaucoma is the open appearance of the\r\n      iridocorneal angle.\r\n\r\n      The most common type of glaucoma is POAG, and its incidence is 0.5-6.6% over the age of 40 in\r\n      western countries. The incidence of POAG increases with age.\r\n\r\n      POAG is a progressive neurodegenerative optic neuropathy characterized by high IOP (\u226521\r\n      mmHg), glaucomatous optic disc, retinal ganglion cells and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL)\r\n      damage, and open iridocorneal angle.\r\n\r\n      POAG is bilateral and usually has an asymmetrical onset. Until the last period, it usually\r\n      does not give any symptoms.\r\n\r\n      POAG is the most common type of open-angle glaucoma and is one of the leading causes of\r\n      preventable blindness. Since POAG is asymptomatic in the early stages, the diagnosis is\r\n      usually made after irreversible visual damage has occurred. With early diagnosis and\r\n      appropriate treatment, the disease can be caught before significant loss of vision develops.\r\n\r\n      Open iridocorneal angle, IOP above 21 mm Hg, and vertical enlargement of the optic disc\r\n      cupping are clinical findings of POAG.\r\n\r\n      As a result of the glaucomatous damage, severe visual field and visual acuity losses develop.\r\n\r\n      Although the biggest risk factor for the progression of the disease is high IOP, it is known\r\n      that other factors also play a role, and glaucoma can develop even under normal pressure.\r\n      Therefore, lowering the intraocular pressure alone cannot cease optic nerve damage in some\r\n      patients.\r\n\r\n      The incidence of POAG is increasing with the aging population. While there were approximately\r\n      44 million cases of POAG all over the world in 2013, it was estimated that this number would\r\n      increase to around 53 million in 2020.\r\n\r\n      Ethnical differences are very common, and they are more common in the black race than in the\r\n      white race and Asian race. The prevalence in the black race, where it is most common, was\r\n      found to be 5.2% at the age of 60 and 12.2% at the age of 80 years. Its incidence increases\r\n      with age. In some studies, it was observed at similar rates in men and women, while in some\r\n      studies it was observed slightly more in men.\r\n\r\n      Family history is a risk factor for POAG. This result reveals the importance of genetic\r\n      transmission.\r\n\r\n      Although many risk factors such as high IOP, family history, race, advanced age, and myopia\r\n      have been identified, the main cause of glaucomatous optic neuropathy is unknown. Humor\r\n      aqueous (HA), produced by the non-pigmented epithelial cells of the ciliary body, is excreted\r\n      mostly iridocorneal via the juxtacanalicular trabecular network and Schlemm's canal\r\n      (conventional), and to a lesser extent by the uveoscleral route and enters the venous\r\n      circulation. POAG 'Rather, it is known that there is a resistance to conventional outflow at\r\n      the level of the juxtacanalicular trabecular meshwork and the inner wall of Schlemm's canal.\r\n      In eyes with glaucoma, histological changes in the collagen structure of the trabecular\r\n      meshwork, the spaces between the trabecular meshwork, and the juxtacanalicular connective\r\n      tissue, and changes in endothelial cell functions were detected. In addition to these\r\n      histological changes, collapse in Schlemm's canal is thought to contribute to the increase in\r\n      resistance to outflow. Along with these, different theories have been proposed that increase\r\n      the outflow resistance. These theories can be listed as follows:\r\n\r\n        -  Occlusion of the trabecular meshwork by accumulated substances,\r\n\r\n        -  Loss of trabecular endothelial cells,\r\n\r\n        -  Decreased trabecular mesh pore density in Schlemm canal inner wall endothelium, loss of\r\n           giant vacuoles,\r\n\r\n        -  Loss of normal phagocytic activity,\r\n\r\n        -  IOP 'Disturbances in the neurological feedback mechanism that concerns the id. In\r\n           addition, complex mechanisms such as increased oxidative stress, excitotoxicity,\r\n           hardening of the lamina cribrosa structure, vascular regulation disorder and ischemia,\r\n           mitochondrial dysfunction, decrease in neurotrophic factors as a result of mechanical\r\n           stress-induced axoplasmic flow disruption, autoimmunity, low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\r\n           pressure also play a role in the etiopathogenesis.\r\n\r\n      The aim of the treatment is to preserve the visual functions without impairing the patient's\r\n      quality of life. When making a treatment plan, the stage of glaucoma, the pressure level at\r\n      which it progresses, and the expected life expectancy of the patient should be considered.\r\n\r\n      Life expectancy and the stage of the disease are important criteria in the choice of\r\n      treatment. A young patient with mild glaucomatous injury should be treated more aggressively\r\n      than an 80-year-old patient with moderate glaucomatous injury.\r\n\r\n      Currently, all treatment modalities are aimed at lowering IOP, as IOP is the only factor that\r\n      can be intervened. According to the treatment protocol accepted all over the world, IOP is\r\n      tried to be controlled primarily with medical treatment. In cases where medical treatment is\r\n      insufficient, laser trabeculoplasty or filter surgery is applied.\r\n\r\n      Today, medical treatment of glaucoma begins with eye drops and usually monotherapy (single\r\n      molecule therapy). If adequate IOP reduction is not achieved with the drug that is started,\r\n      it is switched to another drug from the same group. If the target pressure is still not\r\n      reached, combined therapy is started. In combination therapy, drugs that lower IOP by\r\n      different mechanisms should be combined. Fixed combinations are preferred for ease of use.\r\n\r\n      PAAG 'Drugs used in the treatment of:\r\n\r\n        -  Parasympathomimetic drugs (cholinergic drugs),\r\n\r\n        -  Sympathomimetic drugs,\r\n\r\n        -  Beta blockers,\r\n\r\n        -  Hyperosmotic drugs,\r\n\r\n        -  Calcium channel blockers,\r\n\r\n        -  Prostaglandin analogues,\r\n\r\n        -  Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors,\r\n\r\n        -  Rho kinase inhibitors. More than half of patients suffer from progressive visual field\r\n           loss in long-term medical treatment. However, while the annual rate of visual field loss\r\n           is 32% in inadequately treated patients, this rate is lower in patients with\r\n           well-controlled IOP.\r\n\r\n      These methods are commonly aimed at lowering IOP. However, no method currently used in the\r\n      clinic can fully treat glaucoma and glaucoma-related neurodegeneration. Unfortunately,\r\n      despite adequate pressure control, many patients continue to experience irreversible vision\r\n      loss. The current treatment approach focuses on IOP-independent treatments and\r\n      neuroprotection.\r\n\r\n      In this study, flicker light therapy, the effectiveness of which was investigated in the\r\n      treatment of glaucoma based on some methods used in different diseases, is described for the\r\n      first time in glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      In Alzheimer's, another neurodegenerative disease, similar to glaucoma, its pathophysiology\r\n      is characterized by impaired microcirculation in the brain and retina and pathological\r\n      chronic activation of microglia, resulting in metabolite accumulation in the extracellular\r\n      matrix and chronic inflammation, followed by neurodegeneration and axon loss. There are many\r\n      studies on this subject.\r\n\r\n      Studies investigating the neurodegenerative properties of glaucoma have found similarities in\r\n      the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      40 Hz flicker of light Alzheimer 's the positive effects on the knitted cortex have also been\r\n      shown in studies. 40 Hz flicker light is aimed to reduce glaucoma and retinal ganglion cell\r\n      loss due to glaucoma, by reducing neurodegeneration by decreasing amyloid and metabolite\r\n      accumulation by increasing both microglial phagocytic activation effect and retinal blood\r\n      flow.\r\n\r\n      In this study, it was planned to investigate the effect of reducing the progression of\r\n      glaucomatous damage by applying 40 Hz flicker light therapy for 1 hour a day to POAG\r\n      patients. It is planned to use visual field test, measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer\r\n      (RNFL) and ganglion cell complex (GCC) layer thicknesses in optical coherence tomography to\r\n      investigate the effectiveness of the treatment.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01442896", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["open-angle_glaucoma", "exfoliative_glaucoma", "disc_hemorrhage", "vision_loss", "glaucomatous_optic_neuropathy", "glaucomatous"], "exclusion": ["ophthalmic_disease", "optic_disc_damage", "ocular_disease", "pigmentary_dispersion_syndrome", "hg", "myopia", "hyperopia", "vf", "cataracts"], "brief_title": "STudy to Assess Rapid Disease Progression by Clinical and Genetic Factors In Glaucoma patientS That Are High Risk", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to perform exploratory analyses to evaluate rates of functional\r\n      and structural change in glaucoma, to identify predictors of rapid progression in patients\r\n      with glaucoma and to identify possible genetic factors and biomarkers associated with the\r\n      disease.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n      To identify and combine a set of predictors (i.e. by statistical modeling, machine learning\r\n      classifiers or neural networks) to predict progression in glaucoma patients To determine how\r\n      to most sensitively and specifically determine progression for a trial of a potential\r\n      neuroprotective agent.\r\n\r\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n      To evaluate genetic and other potential biomarkers associated with progression in glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      To evaluate tests currently used on glaucoma patients to better predict which ones are most\r\n      sensitive to detect disease progression and measure rates of change.\r\n\r\n      To assess progression by structural and functional tests:\r\n\r\n        -  Optic disc stereophotographs\r\n\r\n        -  Cirrus OCT\r\n\r\n        -  RTVue OCT\r\n\r\n        -  Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP)\r\n\r\n        -  Frequency Doubling Technology Matrix\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01711190", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open_angle_glaucoma", "tension_glaucoma", "pseudoexfoliation_glaucoma", "pigment_dispersion_glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["primary_angle_closure_glaucoma", "pacg", "ocular_diseases", "glaucoma", "corneal_opacities", "cataract"], "brief_title": "Astigmatism Post-trabeculectomy", "brief_summary": "\n      The aim of this project:\r\n\r\n        1.

Oximetry has provided us with an important\r\n      tool to study metabolism in glaucoma, and to correlate these findings with the available\r\n      blood flow evaluation techniques. Preliminary results by the group of Prof Stef\u00e1nsson (2011)\r\n      with the dual wavelength oximeter pointed out that deeper glaucomatous visual field defects\r\n      are associated with decreased arteriovenous differences in retinal oxygen saturation.

The raise of IOP is based on the increased outflow resistance of\r\n      the trabecular meshwork due to an excessive accumulation of extracellular material in the\r\n      juxtacanalicular tissue of the meshwork in eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and\r\n      an impaired turnover of the trabecular meshwork matrix, which is of paramount importance to\r\n      the regulation and maintenance of aqueous humor outflow.\r\n\r\n      Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome is a systemic disorder of the extracellular matrix, which\r\n      represents the most common identifiable cause of open-angle glaucoma. There is increasing\r\n      evidence suggesting that PEX syndrome may be a type of fibrosis associated with excessive\r\n      synthesis and deposition of an abnormal elastic fibrillar material in many intra- and\r\n      extraocular tissues. Active involvement of the trabecular meshwork in this abnormal matrix\r\n      process leading to progressive accumulation of PEX material in the juxtacanalicular tissue is\r\n      considered to be the primary cause of chronic pressure elevation in eyes with PEX syndrome.\r\n      However, the mechanisms responsible for this aberrant matrix process remain unknown.\r\n      Excessive production and accumulation of abnormal matrix components may be due to increased\r\n      de-novo synthesis, decreased turnover of matrix components, or both.\r\n\r\n      Extracellular matrix turnover is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a large family\r\n      of endopeptidases with variable substrate spectra, the presence of which has been described\r\n      in human aqueous humor.\r\n\r\n      The activity of these enzymes is regulated in part by specific endogenous inhibitors, the\r\n      tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Dysregulated expression of MMPs and TIMPs\r\n      has been implicated in many disease processes accompanied by abnormal matrix production, such\r\n      as fibrotic disorders, and a variety of other disease states. In the eye, abnormal expression\r\n      of MMPs has been implicated, among many other disorders, in glaucoma, in proliferative\r\n      vitreoretinopathy, secondary cataract formation, and the pathogenesis of pterygia. Therefore,\r\n      MMPs and TIMPs are likely candidates to be involved in the abnormal extracellular matrix\r\n      metabolism characteristic of PEX syndrome/glaucoma (PEXG) and POAG.\r\n\r\n      PEX seems to be an independent risk factor for glaucoma. Possibly, this may be due to an\r\n      altered perfusion. So, PEX syndrome represents not only the most common identifiable cause of\r\n      open-angle glaucoma, but also a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. PEX syndrome and\r\n      iris trans-illumination defects are seen in patients with transient ischemic attacks. At the\r\n      microcirculatory level, ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is thought to be initiated by\r\n      chemotactic accumulation of circulating leukocytes, their activation and interaction with the\r\n      endothelium of postcapillary venules. In addition, oxygen free radicals are thought to play a\r\n      pivotal role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury. A variety of experimental models of ischemic\r\n      injury have shown that free radicals induce post-ischemic oxidative damage to DNA. Although\r\n      several human studies have revealed that oxygen radicals generated by other mechanisms like\r\n      irradiation, only few data exist that demonstrate the influence of reperfusion-associated\r\n      oxygen radicals on DNA in humans. We hypothesize that the pathogenic processes in PEX may be\r\n      reflected in leukocytes.\r\n\r\n      Depending on the results that glaucoma patients differ on the level of their mRNA expression\r\n      for various MMPs in peripheral leukocytes and that PEX syndrome is often seen with transient\r\n      ischemic attacks, we assume differences in the activity of MMPs in the plasma as well as\r\n      changes in the DNA stability in peripheral leukocytes of patients with PEX glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      This study is, therefore, designed to analyze the activity of gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9) in\r\n      plasma and the degree of DNA fragmentation in peripheral leukocytes of patients with PEX\r\n      syndrome and PEXG compared to POAG and controls.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00570362", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": 80.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucomatous", "vf", "glaucoma", "glaucomatous_optic_disc_cupping"], "exclusion": ["iridocorneal_angles", "secondary_open-angle_glaucoma", "ocular_disease", "cataract", "hypertension", "ocular_diseases", "diabetic_retinopathy", "macular_degeneration", "visual_field_defects", "glutathione", "autoimmune_diseases", "alcoholic_liver_disease", "cancer", "diabetes_mellitus"], "brief_title": "Systemic Glutathione Level in Normal Tension Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether systemic glutathione level is decreased in\r\n      patients with normal tension glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Normal tension glaucoma is one of the most common cause of primary open angle glaucoma in\r\n      Korea.

Special considerations are needed when\r\n      choosing which surgical strategy to undertake when either of these two conditions requires\r\n      surgical management. When performed prior to cataract surgery, trabeculectomy increases the\r\n      risk of cataract formation by up to 78%, while subsequent cataract surgery may increase the\r\n      risk of elevated intraocular pressure or trabeculectomy failure. By contrast, when cataract\r\n      surgery alone is performed in glaucoma patients; an early postoperative intraocular pressure\r\n      spike sometimes requiring medical treatment is commonly reported. Therefore,\r\n      phacotrabeculectomy, a procedure that combines the management of these two conditions\r\n      together in one surgery, may be considered in these situations.\r\n\r\n      When to Consider Combined Surgery\r\n\r\n      Combined cataract extraction and glaucoma surgery (trabeculectomy, glaucoma drainage implant\r\n      surgery, or any of the newer surgical approaches for glaucoma) should be carefully selected\r\n      and individualized depending on clinical findings in each case:\r\n\r\n        -  Cataract surgery alone is sufficient for patients with well controlled in intraocular\r\n           pressure in the setting of early to moderate optic nerve damage.\r\n\r\n        -  Patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure in the presence of severe optic nerve\r\n           damage should receive glaucoma surgery first, followed by cataract extraction a few\r\n           months later\r\n\r\n        -  Combined surgery may be best suited for a patient with a visually significant cataract\r\n           with uncontrolled glaucoma despite maximal medical therapy and/or laser trabeculoplasty.\r\n           Cost is often an issue for many patients and eliminating medications can help reduce the\r\n           financial burden. Poor compliance with glaucoma medications can also be an issue to\r\n           consider both procedures together.\r\n\r\n      The indication for phaco-trabeculectomy was the simultaneous presence of a visually\r\n      significant cataract and open angle glaucoma requiring medications, poor patient compliance,\r\n      advanced glaucomatous optic nerve damage or visual field loss, or medically uncontrolled\r\n      glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Effect of cataract surgery on anterior segment:\r\n\r\n      Cataract surgery and intraocular lens implantation lead to significant increases in anterior\r\n      chamber depth and anterior chamber angle.\r\n\r\n      Trabeculectomy lead to significant decrease in anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber\r\n      angle.The effects of trabeculectomy on anterior segment parameters measured by optical\r\n      biometry in Primary open-angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and found in primary\r\n      open angle glaucoma , intraocular pressure and anterior chamber depth decreased at the 1st\r\n      and 3rd months significantly. Conclusion: Trabeculectomy cause some differences in anterior\r\n      segment parameters in both primary open angle glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation cases and the\r\n      differences between these changes in both groups were found to be insignificant.\r\n\r\n      Anterior Segment - Optical Coherence Tomography is a useful tool to evaluate filtering blebs\r\n      or glaucoma drainage devices in the postoperative period. Clinically , blebs can be described\r\n      as diffuse, cystic, encapsulated, or flat. However, these descriptions are subjective and\r\n      there may be cases in which clinical appearance does not correlate with bleb function.\r\n      Therefore, visualizing intra bleb morphology with anterior segment imaging may enhance our\r\n      understanding of different surgical outcomes and wound healing. The noncontact anterior\r\n      Segment - Optical Coherence Tomography scanning provides a significant advantage over\r\n      ultrasound biomicroscopy in eliminating direct trauma to the bleb or reducing the risk of\r\n      potential infection that could occur with the use of an eye-cup or probe .In addition, the\r\n      higher scanning resolution of allows differentiating the subconjunctival fluid collection and\r\n      the supra sclera fluid space. The anterior segment - optical coherence tomography used to\r\n      describe intra- bleb morphology and structures, including bleb wall thickness,\r\n      subconjunctival fluid collections, supra sclera fluid space, sclera flap thickness, and\r\n      intra-bleb intensity. Anterior segment - optical coherence tomography allows visualization of\r\n      the glaucoma drainage devices in the anterior chamber to assess their position or potential\r\n      occlusion .\r\n\r\n      Effect of phacotrabeculectomy on anterior chamber depth:\r\n\r\n      Phacotrabeculectomy lead to increases in anterior chamber depth and anterior chamber angle.\r\n      Poon, Linda Yi-Chieh et al studied comparison of surgical outcomes after phacotrabeculectomy\r\n      in primary angle-closure glaucoma versus primary open-angle glaucoma found; the primary angle\r\n      closure glaucoma group had an anterior chamber depth that was significantly shallower than\r\n      the primary open-angle glaucoma group prior to surgery. However, after surgery, the mean\r\n      anterior chamber depth in the primary angle closure glaucoma group increased to a depth\r\n      similar to the primary open-angle glaucoma group.\r\n\r\n      Imaging of the anterior segment of the eye Imaging of the anterior segment of the eye offers\r\n      an objective method for visualizing the angle and adjacent anatomical structures. In addition\r\n      to qualitative analyses, some imaging modalities permit quantitative analyses that can be\r\n      used to monitor change or progression over time.\r\n\r\n      Ultrasound Biomicroscopy uses high frequency ultrasound (35-100 MHz) to provide high\r\n      resolution images of the angle. Ultrasound Biomicroscopy has shown good agreement with\r\n      gonioscopy in assessing the anterior chamber angle. Although is a useful technology capable\r\n      of providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses, its major advantage lies in its\r\n      ability to visualize structures posterior to the iris to detect various causes of secondary\r\n      angle closure, such as plateau iris, ciliary effusions, or irido-ciliary masses. The\r\n      disadvantages of ultrasound biomicroscopy include required supine position, use of\r\n      anesthesia, need for a skilled examiner, longer image acquisition time, and contact with the\r\n      eye using a cup with a coupling medium or a probe that can lead to corneal abrasion or\r\n      potential infection.\r\n\r\n      Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography uses the principle of low-coherence\r\n      interferometry instead of ultrasound to produce, cross sectional, non-contact,\r\n      three-dimensional, high-resolution imaging modality of the anterior segment of the eye. The\r\n      technique measures the delay and intensity of the light reflected from the tissue structure\r\n      being analyzed and compares it with the light reflected by a reference mirror. The\r\n      combination of these two signals results in interference phenomenon. The signal intensity\r\n      depends on the optical properties of the tissues, and the device uses these signals to\r\n      construct a sagittal cross-section image of the structure being analyzed. OCT technology was\r\n      initially used to produce images of the posterior segment of the eye by using a wavelength of\r\n      820nm. In 2001, the wavelength was altered to 1310nm to allow better penetration through\r\n      light retaining tissues such as the sclera and limbus and to improve visualization of the\r\n      anterior segment. Compared with ultrasound biomicroscopy , this technology provides a higher\r\n      axial resolution and faster sampling rate (2.0 kHz versus 0.8 kHz). Another main clinical\r\n      advantage over ultrasound biomicroscopy is its ability to provide non contact scanning in a\r\n      seated, upright position..The major drawback for anterior segment optical coherence\r\n      tomography is its inability to visualize structures posterior to the iris due to blockage of\r\n      wavelength by pigment. This limits its application in screening several secondary causes of\r\n      angle closure, such as plateau iris, ciliary body cyst or tumor, lens subluxation, or ciliary\r\n      effusions.\r\n\r\n      Biometric parameters which can be measured with the anterior segment optical coherence\r\n      tomography:\r\n\r\n      Iris thickness ,iris cross- sectional area ,iris curvature ,AC depth ,AC width ,angle opening\r\n      distance , angle recess area , scleral thickness, trabecular meshwork ciliary process\r\n      distance ,trabecular iris angle , lens vault.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT04651530", "minimum_age": 55.0, "maximium_age": 100.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["tension_glaucoma", "visual_field_defects"], "exclusion": ["secondary_glaucoma", "uveitis", "exfoliation_syndrome", "pigment_dispersion_syndrome", "eye_injury", "zonular_weakness", "marfan_syndrome", "retinal_detachment", "diabetic_retonopathy", "fuchs'dystrophy", "dementia", "loss_of_central_visual_field"], "brief_title": "Endoscopic Cyclophotocoagulation in Normal Tension Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to assess whether endoscopic cyclophotocoagulation added to\r\n      cataract surgery lowers intraocular pressure more than cataract surgery alone in patients\r\n      with normal tension glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Subjects with normal tension glaucoma that is stable with current medication needing cataract\r\n      surgery are recruited in the study.

The\r\n      production of peripheral anterior synechiae along the trabecular meshwork leads to\r\n      progressive angle closure. The subsequent elevation in intraocular pressure is difficult to\r\n      manage, often leading to rapid progression of glaucoma and significant loss of vision.\r\n      Enucleation for blind, painful eyes secondary to neovascular glaucoma is not an uncommon\r\n      sequelae.\r\n\r\n      Neovascular glaucoma has many etiologic causes, the vast majority resulting from retinal\r\n      ischemia secondary to relatively common diseases such as central retinal vein occlusion,\r\n      proliferative diabetic retinopathy and ocular ischemic syndrome (carotid stenosis).\r\n      (Sivac-Callcott et al., 2001) Vascular endothelial growth factor is likely a major\r\n      contributor to the development of angle and iris neovascularization. (Ferrara, 2004) Although\r\n      panretinal photocoagulation and/or cryoablation are mainstays of conventional treatment for\r\n      neovascular glaucoma, the delayed therapeutic effect of these interventions often results in\r\n      the formation of peripheral anterior synechiae and permanent angle closure.\r\n\r\n      Recent limited case series have demonstrated a role for bevacizumab (Avastin) in reducing\r\n      rubeosis iridis and as an adjunct for neovascular glaucoma. (Grisanti et al., 2006; Davidorf\r\n      et al., 2006; Iliev et al., 2006; Kahook, Schuman, Noecker, 2006) However, no prospective\r\n      studies have examined the potential utility of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents\r\n      in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma. Intravitreal Lucentis is the standard of care for\r\n      the treatment of exudative macular degeneration. Pharmacologic agents such as Lucentis, which\r\n      selectively inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor may provide an important therapeutic\r\n      adjunct for the treatment of neovascular glaucoma by more immediately causing regression of\r\n      angle neovascularization and thereby providing a window for permanent treatment with laser or\r\n      cryotherapy.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT02653963", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": 80.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["cataract"], "brief_title": "Triamcinolone for Ahmed Glaucoma Valve", "brief_summary": "\n      This triple-blind, stratified, randomized clinical trial includes 100 eyes of 100 patients\r\n      aged 18 to 85 years with refractory glaucoma.

Determine the sensitivity and specificity of glaucoma diagnosis based on advanced\r\n           imaging tests.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the US. Traditional methods of glaucoma diagnosis\r\n      and monitoring lack good sensitivity and specificity. Delays in detecting glaucoma\r\n      progression can lead to inadequate treatment and irreversible visual loss. Our goal is to\r\n      improve glaucoma diagnosis by utilizing new imaging modalities that can reveal changes in the\r\n      retinal layers affected by glaucoma and the associated reduction in retinal blood flow.\r\n      Glaucoma selectively damages the retinal nerve fibers, which originate from cell bodies in\r\n      ganglion cell layer (GCL) and travel to the optic nerve via the nerve fiber layer (NFL). We\r\n      hypothesize that subtle damages in these structures can be detected earlier by optical\r\n      coherence tomography (OCT) and other advanced imaging modalities than with current standard\r\n      methods. OCT is based on infrared light reflectometry. It provides micrometer-scale\r\n      cross-sectional images of retinal structures, which are not possible with other non-invasive\r\n      techniques. More than 7,000 OCT systems are already being used for the diagnosis of glaucoma\r\n      and retinal diseases. Phase I of the Advanced Imaging for Glaucoma (AIG) study demonstrated\r\n      that peripapillary NFL thickness measured with the standard timedomain (TD) OCT technology\r\n      has higher glaucoma diagnostic accuracy than other quantitative diagnostic technologies such\r\n      as scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) and scanning laser tomography (SLT). We also demonstrated\r\n      that more advanced diagnostic software and faster Fourier-domain (FD) OCT systems can achieve\r\n      even better diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility. In the proposed Phase II of the AIG\r\n      study, we will continue the most promising aspects of the research to further improve both\r\n      technology and clinical practice.\r\n\r\n      The AIG Partnership investigators at the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU),\r\n      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and University of Pittsburgh (UP) include those\r\n      who invented OCT and pioneered its applications to glaucoma. OHSU, University of Southern\r\n      California (USC), UP and University of Miami (UM) also have major glaucoma referral centers.\r\n\r\n      The Partnership combines engineers and clinicians who have the track record and synergy to\r\n      develop novel technologies, evaluate them in a rigorous clinical study, and transfer the\r\n      knowledge to industry and medicine.\r\n\r\n      The Specific Aims of this competing renewal proposal are:\r\n\r\n        1. Develop image processing and diagnostic analysis for 3-dimensional OCT data. The AIG\r\n           study is currently using 26 kHz (axial scan repetition rate) FD-OCT technology that is\r\n           capable of scanning the macula and the optic nerve head in a fraction of a second. We\r\n           have completed computer algorithms for mapping and analysis of the macular ganglion cell\r\n           complex (mGCC) and the peripapillary NFL, which lead to significant improvement in\r\n           diagnostic accuracy. We propose to continue the work on disc cupping analysis, NFL\r\n           reflectivity analysis, and expert system combination of multiple anatomic parameters to\r\n           further improve diagnostic accuracy. Algorithms to detect progression of glaucoma over\r\n           time are also planned.\r\n\r\n        2. Develop ultrafast OCT systems for imaging of the macula and optic nerve head. Although\r\n           current FD-OCT technology at 26 kHz represents a tremendous advance over standard 400 Hz\r\n           TD-OCT (Zeiss Stratus), it still takes ~4 seconds for a full 3-dimensional (3D) raster\r\n           scan of the macula. Our goal is to reduce this time to 0.1-0.2 second so 3D scans will\r\n           be minimally affected by eye movement. This requires an ultrafast speed of 500-1000 kHz.\r\n           We plan to adapt the Fourier-domain modelocked-laser (FDML) swept-source OCT, which has\r\n           already been demonstrated at 249 kHz at MIT. We will further improve its speed to 500\r\n           kHz. The short integration time and phase stability of FDML-OCT is ideal for Doppler\r\n           perfusion measurement (see next aim). For an even faster speed, parallel line-scan\r\n           FD-OCT at 1 MHz will be developed. Line-scan OCT is not suitable for Doppler flow\r\n           measurement due to the relatively long integration time, but is more efficient for\r\n           ultrafast anatomic imaging. It will allow full 8x8 mm macular 3D imaging in 0.2 second.\r\n           We will also continue to develop polarization-sensitive (PS) OCT for NFL birefringence\r\n           measurement, which will also be greatly enhanced by higher speed and greater averaging\r\n           to suppress noise.\r\n\r\n        3. Develop Doppler OCT to measure retinal perfusion. One of the significant achievements of\r\n           the AIG project is the demonstration of a reproducible method of measuring total retinal\r\n           blood flow using Doppler FD-OCT. Reduced flow was found in glaucomatous eyes, opening an\r\n           important new approach to measure the severity of glaucoma and assess the risk for\r\n           further progression. An automated algorithm will be developed to improve the robustness\r\n           of Doppler flow measurement. We will also investigate Doppler OCT with the ultrafast\r\n           FDML-OCT system.\r\n\r\n        4. Evaluate OCT technologies in a longitudinal clinical study. An extension of the ongoing\r\n           clinical study is proposed. Participants (1000 planned with 700+ already enrolled) in\r\n           normal, glaucoma suspect, and glaucoma groups will be followed. OCT and other imaging\r\n           technologies will be compared for diagnostic accuracy, detection of early progression,\r\n           and prediction of future visual field loss. The impact of intraocular pressure on\r\n           retinal blood flow and how flow affects the risk of glaucoma will also be studied.\r\n\r\n      Quantitative imaging technologies such as OCT have improved glaucoma management by reducing\r\n      reliance on insensitive tests such as perimetry and subjective disc grading. The AIG\r\n      Partnership comprises engineers and clinicians who co-invented OCT. We propose to further\r\n      improve its performance with higher speed, more sophisticated software, and novel functional\r\n      measurements. The eventual goal is to save vision by basing glaucoma treatment decisions on\r\n      speedy and reliable imaging tests.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT04647929", "minimum_age": null, "maximium_age": 18.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["congenital_glaucoma", "pcg", "developmental_glaucoma", "dg"], "exclusion": ["glaucoma"], "brief_title": "Comparison of Surgical Treatment Options for Primary Congenital and Developmental Glaucomas", "brief_summary": "\n      Newborn and children can be affected by two subgroups of this disease: (1) primary congenital\r\n      glaucoma (PCG) or (2) developmental glaucoma (DG).

A key component in the management of glaucoma, is\r\n      the use of prescribed medications\u00b7 but the effectiveness of medications depends on patient's\r\n      adherence to treatment.

(1) Medication\r\n      alone is sometimes not sufficient to reduce excessively high IOP, and pharmaceutical\r\n      intolerance may develop or damage can occur to the optic nerve, warranting surgical\r\n      intervention. (2) The filtering bleb is considered to be the cornerstone of IOP control after\r\n      glaucoma filtration surgery drainage device implantation. (3) It enables the flow of the\r\n      aqueous humor from the anterior chamber to the subconjunctiva, episclera, sclera and choroid,\r\n      thereby lowering the IOP. (4-6) Filtration and drainage devices, such as the EX-Press device\r\n      (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, Texas, USA), offer a surgical alternative to glaucoma\r\n      medical therapy. (7) Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is generally managed by decreasing the\r\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) to a level that the physician believes will prevent further\r\n      glaucomatous damage. However, in a significant proportion of patients, the visual fields\r\n      continue to deteriorate in spite of office pressures within the range of normal values (8).\r\n      It has been suggested that the progressive damage in some cases could be caused by peaks of\r\n      IOP or diurnal IOP variability not detected by tonometry during office hours. (9, 10) In\r\n      another study, Asrani et al. (11) showed that IOP fluctuations are an independent risk factor\r\n      in patients with glaucoma and as such may need to be treated specifically. It is possible\r\n      that certain drugs or surgical interventions are more effective than others in dampening\r\n      these fluctuations. The purpose of our study is to compare the diurnal IOP fluctuations in\r\n      glaucoma patients treated with medications or Ex-press filtration surgery.\r\n\r\n      Materials and Methods The study will include 20 open-angle glaucoma (OAG) patients underwent\r\n      Ex-Press filtration surgery, and 20 OAG patients treated with medications alone.

The rebound motion of its light weighted probe will be recorded during contact of the\r\n      probe with the cornea. (12, 13) The rate of deceleration of the probe is a function of IOP.\r\n      The ICARE\u00ae PRO has a built-in inclination sensor that allows downward measurement of the eye\r\n      in the supine position as well as in the normal upright sitting position. ICARE\u00ae PRO allows\r\n      for measurement of IOP in the seated and supine positions. During IOP recording, patients\r\n      will be supine or upright, and the tip of the probe will be applied perpendicular to the\r\n      cornea. Two markers engraved on the piston of the probe indicated its ideal positioning. The\r\n      reliability of the measurement is displayed on the ICARE\u00ae PRO tonometer screen and guided our\r\n      measurements.\r\n\r\n      Fluctuations in IOP will be compared between the Ex-press filtration surgery eye and the\r\n      fellow (intra-group comparison).

Since changes to the\r\n      optic nerve and other eye structures due to glaucoma are irreversible, it is important to\r\n      develop tools for the earliest possible detection of changes due to glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      The Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT) is a device that is used to produce a three-dimensional\r\n      map of the optic nerve and retina, and can be used to detect changes in the optic nerve and\r\n      retina over time. In previous studies, it has been shown to be useful for the detection of\r\n      changes due to glaucoma.

The same good results were obtained by the same\r\n      authors, in another study, in a small subgroup of 16 patients who were monitored for\r\n      glaucomatous progression by both HRT and ONH stereophotographs for approximately 5.5 years.\r\n\r\n      However, in our recent retrospective study, our results demonstrated only fair agreement\r\n      between HRT and clinical judgment of ONH stereophotographs for progression in glaucoma, for a\r\n      mean follow-up time with HRT of 2.62 years. Although, the evaluation of the ONH\r\n      stereophotographs is necessarily subjective, it is widely accepted and has been shown to be\r\n      effective for evaluating change. Using the stereophotographs assessments as the \"reference\r\n      standard\", the HRT sensitivity was 78% and the specificity to 70%. The positive predictive\r\n      value of the HRT was 47.8%, while the negative predictive value was 90.3%.\r\n\r\n      According to the results of this study if the frequency of true positives and false positives\r\n      does not change with longer follow-up, treatment decisions would be based on a test that may\r\n      be in error 52.2% of the time.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, our previous - and other studies - study demonstrated only fair agreement\r\n      between HRT and clinical judgment of ONH stereophotographs for progression in glaucoma.

Thus, in the current study, the\r\n      investigators set out to determine whether this blood flow response is impaired in patients\r\n      with glaucoma as compared to those in healthy volunteers and whether this is related to\r\n      altered neural activity.\r\n\r\n      The study objective was, to investigate whether the blood flow response to flicker\r\n      stimulation is altered in patients with glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT00346541", "minimum_age": 40.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucomatous_optic_neuropathy", "loss_of_neuroretinal_rim", "visual_field_loss", "poag", "hg"], "exclusion": ["secondary_angle_closure", "ocular_diseases"], "brief_title": "Role of Polymorphisms in the IL-1 Gene Cluster", "brief_summary": "\n      Glaucoma, an optic neuropathy characterized by progressive visual field loss, is the leading\r\n      cause of irreversible blindness worldwide.

Based on WHO Global Data Bank on Blindness, glaucoma\r\n      accounts for 5.1 million of the estimated 38 million blind in the world.1Glaucoma affects\r\n      approximately 70 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness\r\n      in the world2. As the number of elderly in the world rapidly increases, glaucoma morbidity\r\n      will rise, causing increased health care costs and economic burden. This has important public\r\n      health implications for a condition in which visual loss, once established, cannot be\r\n      reversed. The major risk factor in glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure due to reduction\r\n      in aqueous outflow.\r\n\r\n      Previous studies have shown that glaucoma is a major cause of visual morbidity in\r\n      Singapore3-5. In a population based survey conducted on Chinese Singaporeans in the Tanjong\r\n      Pagar district, the age-standardized prevalence of glaucoma was found to be 3.2% (95%\r\n      confidence interval, 2.3-4.1) in the population 40 years and older.3\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma has a major genetic basis, estimated to account for a third (range 20 - 60%) of all\r\n      glaucoma cases, 6-8 although a recent report suggests that this is an underestimate.9 Genetic\r\n      heterogeneity is illustrated by the more than 15 loci and 7 glaucoma-causing genes identified\r\n      to date, 10 including 2 genes identified for POAG.11-12 A diverse variety of genetic\r\n      mechanisms have been found to induce open angle and developmental glaucomas and these include\r\n      coding mutations, particularly in transcription factors, 13 altered gene dosage14 and\r\n      dominant negative effects.15\r\n\r\n      Interleukin-1 is an important mediator of inflammation. There are 2 pro-inflammatory\r\n      cytokines, Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta. Both are produced by monocytes, macrophages and\r\n      epithelial cells as host responses to tissue injury. The genes encoding Il-1 are located\r\n      within a 430kb region on chromosome 2q14.216. Polymorphisms of the Il-1 gene cluster have\r\n      been shown to alter protein _expression. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been linked to\r\n      other diseases such as pre-eclampsia among other medical conditions17.\r\n\r\n      _Expression of the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) in trabecular meshwork\r\n      cells has been identified to be a diagnostic marker of glaucoma18. _Expression of ELAM-1 is\r\n      controlled by activation of Il-1 autocrine feedback loop, which is controlled through\r\n      transcription factor NF-Kappa -Beta. It has been shown that Il-1 produced endogenously by\r\n      glaucomatous cells inhibits the apoptotic response to oxidative stress18. Il-1 has also been\r\n      reported to increase outflow facility by stimulating the _expression of matrix\r\n      metalloproteinase enzymes, which in turn reduces extra cellular resistance19-22. The effect\r\n      of Il-1 on the synthesis of Nitric oxide causing a relaxation in ciliary muscle tone may also\r\n      be contributory in increasing aqueous outflow23.\r\n\r\n      Recently, Wang et al has shown that Il-1 variants result in increased secretion of Il-1 and\r\n      thus reduces the risk of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) 24. This was presented at the\r\n      recent ARVO meeting 2005 in Florida, USA, under \" New ideas in glaucoma\". The group led by Dr\r\n      Elizabeth Fini from Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, Miami, identified genetic variants (+3953T)\r\n      of the Il-1 \u03b2, which is a protective factor against POAG. They assessed genomic DNA from 100\r\n      POAG patients and 104 normal controls in the Caucasian population over 40 years. The allele\r\n      frequency of Il-1 Beta (+3953T) was significantly higher in normal controls than in the POAG\r\n      group (28% versus 17%, p=0.01). They also found that the allele frequency of Il-1 alpha\r\n      (-889T) was higher in normal controls than in the POAG group at borderline significance (39%\r\n      versus 29%, p=0.06). This may prove to be significant with a larger sample size.\r\n\r\n      In this project, we hope to determine if polymorphisms in the Il-1 gene cluster found in the\r\n      Caucasians are also protective for glaucoma patients in Asian populations. We also aim to\r\n      determine if there are differences in the distribution of polymorphisms of the Il-1 gene\r\n      cluster in normotensive glaucoma patients versus high-pressure glaucoma patients. Both\r\n      primary angle closure and primary open angle glaucoma patients will be studied. The study\r\n      will be the first to investigate such changes in PACG, a major cause of blindness in Asia,\r\n      and considered to be an IOP-dependent disease. The study findings may have implications on\r\n      the genetic basis of glaucoma, placing the focus on the role of the immune system in IOP\r\n      response and glaucoma pathogenesis. This is a pilot study of the role of immune system\r\n      related polymorphisms and depending on the results, we may embark on a larger investigation\r\n      of the role of other immune genes in glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Methods\r\n\r\n      Patient Recruitment:\r\n\r\n      At least 300 patients with primary glaucoma will be recruited in the study from glaucoma\r\n      clinics at Singapore National Eye Centre. This will consist of PACG, POAG and NTG patients.\r\n      There will be another 100 control patients with no clinical evidence of glaucoma recruited\r\n      from the general clinics. Individuals with secondary angle closure and other ocular diseases\r\n      will be excluded.\r\n\r\n      Patient assessment and examination Examination, of both eyes, will include best-corrected\r\n      Snellen visual acuity, goniscopy, intraocular pressure measurement by Goldmann applanation\r\n      tonometer, slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, lens, vitreous and retina. In\r\n      addition, a scanning laser ophthalmoscope, the Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT, Heidelberg\r\n      Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) will be used to image the optic disc in all subjects.\r\n      Global and segmental disc and cup areas will be analysed directly by means of HRT software\r\n      (version 2.01b) using the standard reference plane. Rim area will be calculated by\r\n      subtracting the cup area from the disc area. Glaucoma severity will be classified by global\r\n      indices in the visual fields as well as by HRT neuroretinal rim area. Axial length will also\r\n      be measured with the IOL-Master (Carl Zeiss Jena GmbH, Jena, Germany). 10 mls of blood will\r\n      be obtained from each patient by venepuncture.\r\n\r\n      Standardized inclusion criteria for glaucoma will be used, which is the presence of\r\n      glaucomatous optic neuropathy (defined as loss of neuroretinal rim with a cup:disc ratio of\r\n      0.7 or greater) with compatible visual field loss. PACG will be defined as the presence of at\r\n      least 180 degrees of angle in which the trabecular meshwork is not visible on gonioscopy with\r\n      the presence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy. POAG patients will have open angles on\r\n      gonioscopy; POAG patients with a mean IOP without treatment that is consistently less than 21\r\n      mm Hg on diurnal testing will be classified as NTG.\r\n\r\n      DNA Preparation and Genotyping\r\n\r\n      Genomic DNA will be extracted from leukocytes of the peripheral blood using Nucleon DNA\r\n      Extraction kits. The Il-1alpha (-889), Il-beta (-511), and Il-1beta (+3953) variants will be\r\n      detected by specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (using primers in Table 1), followed by\r\n      digestion with restriction enzyme digests as described in Table 1. Confirmation of\r\n      polymorphisms would be carried out by direct sequencing.\r\n\r\n      The methodology is fairly straightforward and the lab work can be performed by Dr Alicia How\r\n      (Registrar, SNEC) during her research session each week.

At this\r\n      point, if the patient was assigned to the treatment group the surgeon instilled acetylcholine\r\n      1% to reduce the pupillary size and facilitate visualization of the angle structures. To help\r\n      maintain width, the anterior chamber was filled with a viscoelastic agent. Since the ab\r\n      interno trabeculectomy is performed in the nasal quadrant, the surgeons then situated\r\n      temporal, the patient's head was rotated 45 degrees in the opposite direction of the surgical\r\n      site, and the microscope was tilted 30 to 45 degrees towards the surgeon. To guarantee better\r\n      access to the nasal area of the angle, a 1.8 mm keratome was employed to widen the\r\n      paracentesis. Further details of the surgical technique are described elsewhere.\r\n\r\n      Postoperative medications and follow-up Hypotensive medication was not administered intra- or\r\n      post-operatively unless an IOP spike was detected. Postoperative topical treatment included a\r\n      fixed combination of antibiotic plus steroid (tobramycin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1%) six\r\n      times a day for seven days; this was tapered over the next four weeks.\r\n\r\n      Visits were undertaken at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, and 12\r\n      months. During follow-up, results of the slit-lamp examination, applanation tonometer IOP,\r\n      and the number of medications were recorded at all visits. The VF and the ECC were also\r\n      re-tested at 6 and 12 months. All the postoperative visits were conducted by the same\r\n      examiner (NVA). Topical glaucoma medication was re-introduced if the target IOP according to\r\n      the severity of the visual field was not achieved, o a higher than preoperative IOP was\r\n      found.\r\n\r\n      Outcome measures - Data analysis Data obtained from each group were evaluated to determine\r\n      the efficacy and safety of both interventions. The primary study outcomes were IOP and the\r\n      number of glaucoma treatments. VF, ECC, BCVA and simK were secondary outcomes used to define\r\n      the safety of both procedures. Success was defined as an IOP reduction of \u2265 20% from\r\n      baseline; this cut-off was based on that reported in other glaucoma surgeries and is used for\r\n      evaluation of this trabecular technique. The Saphiro-Wilk test was used to assess the sample\r\n      distribution. Independent and dependent sample t-tests, when possible, were used to compare\r\n      the results between groups and over time for each group. As both eyes of the same patient\r\n      could be included in any of the treatment groups, generalized estimating equations (GEE) for\r\n      repeated measures (IOP and number of medications) were also performed. A random-effect\r\n      logistic regression was employed to analyse baseline characteristics associated with the\r\n      success endpoint (IOP reduction of \u226520% from baseline). Statistical significance was set at a\r\n      two-sided p-value \u2264 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata\u00ae version 14.1\r\n      (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA).\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01957267", "minimum_age": 40.0, "maximium_age": 85.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["hg", "pallor", "hemorrhage"], "exclusion": ["hemorrhages", "cataract", "diabetic_retinopathy", "optic_disc_abnormalities"], "brief_title": "Functional and Structural Imaging for Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      The specific aims of the clinical studies are to:\r\n\r\n        -  Develop a directional high-resolution OCT and OCT angiography prototype to improve\r\n           imaging of structure and perfusion.\r\n\r\n        -  Validate wide-field OCT and OCT angiography parameters to improve early glaucoma\r\n           detection.\r\n\r\n        -  Simulate visual field results by combining structural and angiography OCT data.\r\n\r\n        -  Assess abilities of above technologies and OCT-derived parameters on predicting glaucoma\r\n           detection, conversion, and progression.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the US. The diagnosis and monitoring of\r\n      glaucoma are important problems, not only because of its prevalence, but also because of its\r\n      silent and irreversible nature. However all of the current diagnostic tests have serious\r\n      limitations. Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a risk factor, most glaucoma\r\n      patients actually have IOP within normal range. Visual field (VF) tests are poorly\r\n      reproducible, and a series of 3 tests are needed to establish diagnosis or confirm\r\n      progression. Although ophthalmoscopic examination can detect optic nerve head (ONH) and nerve\r\n      fiber layer (NFL) defects, reliability in diagnosis and tracking is hampered by its\r\n      subjective and semi-quantitative nature. Although quantitative imaging with optical coherence\r\n      tomography (OCT), scanning laser polarimetry (SLP), and confocal scanning laser\r\n      ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) can more objectively detect ONH and NFL defects, their diagnostic\r\n      accuracies are still not sufficient to be relied on alone for diagnostic screening. It has\r\n      been estimated that about half of glaucoma patients in the US do not know that they have the\r\n      disease. Thus, there is a need for improvements in glaucoma diagnostic technologies. One\r\n      approach that deserves further exploration is blood flow imaging.\r\n\r\n      There is much circumstantial evidence that vascular factors play important roles in the\r\n      pathophysiology of glaucoma:\r\n\r\n        1. Systemic vasculopathy increases the risk of developing glaucoma. Hypertension, diabetes,\r\n           and vasospastic conditions are all known risk factors. Normal tension glaucoma has also\r\n           been linked to peripheral endothelial dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. This\r\n           suggests that poor circulation may be a causative factor or a facilitative factor that\r\n           predisposes the ONH to damage by elevated IOP.\r\n\r\n        2. Decrease or fluctuation in ocular perfusion pressure was identified as an independent\r\n           risk factor for progression in the Collaborative Normal-Tension Glaucoma Study and other\r\n           studies. Nocturnal hypotension is also a risk factor for glaucoma progression.\r\n\r\n        3. Medications that improve ocular perfusion appear to have protective effects that are not\r\n           explained by the lowering of IOP.\r\n\r\n        4. Optic disc hemorrhage and peripapillary atrophy are both associated with accelerated\r\n           glaucoma progression. These finding may support a role for focal ischemia.\r\n\r\n        5. Animal experiments show that increased IOP causes decreased ONH blood flow in the\r\n           presence of low systemic blood pressure.\r\n\r\n      Despite the evidence, the management of glaucoma remains focused on the lowering of IOP, the\r\n      one causative factor that responds to treatment and can be easily measured. Blood flow\r\n      measurement is a research topic, but currently has no clinical role in the diagnosis,\r\n      prognostic evaluation, or treatment of glaucoma. Therapies aimed at improving ocular\r\n      circulation cannot be effectively developed without a practical method for quantitative and\r\n      reproducible evaluation of ONH and retinal perfusion. Thus there is a great need to develop\r\n      better technology for the evaluation of ocular circulation.\r\n\r\n      Using high-speed OCT systems, we have developed new methods to image and measure optic nerve\r\n      head (ONH) and retinal blood flow. Preliminary results showed that VF loss was more highly\r\n      correlated with retinal blood flow as measured by OCT than any neural structure measured by\r\n      OCT or other imaging modality. Accordingly, the goal of the proposed project is to improve\r\n      the diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of glaucoma by further developing novel functional\r\n      OCT measurements using ultrahigh-speed (70-100 kHz) OCT technology.\r\n\r\n      Retinal blood flow, ONH circulation, optic disc rim volume, peripapillary nerve fiber layer\r\n      volume, and macular ganglion cell complex volume are all pieces of the same glaucoma puzzle.\r\n      This project will develop novel imaging methods that allow us to look at the whole picture\r\n      using one tool - ultrahigh-speed OCT.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01314170", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open_angle_glaucoma", "pseudoesfolia\u00e7\u00e3o", "pigmented", "primary_angle_closure"], "exclusion": ["staphyloma", "cleritis", "psychiatric_disorder", "retinal_detachment", "corneal_opacity", "aphakia", "glaucoma"], "brief_title": "Evaluation of Efficacy and Safety of Susanna Implant in Patients With Refractory Glaucoma.", "brief_summary": "\n      Study clinical multicenter, phase III, open-label, prospective character to evaluate the\r\n      efficacy and safety Susanna Implant in patients with refractory glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Clinical trial multicenter, phase III,open-label, prospective character to evaluate the\r\n      efficacy and safety of Susanna Implant in patients with refractory glaucoma of both genders,\r\n      of any race, aged above 18 years and diagnosed with glaucoma refractory.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01540331", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open_angle_glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["timolol", "iritis", "uveitis", "inflammatory_glaucoma", "hemorrhagic_glaucoma", "post-traumatic_glaucoma", "phacolytic_glaucoma", "glaucomatocyclitic", "closed_angle/narrow_angle_glaucoma", "diabetic_retinopathy", "perimetric_defects", "ular_degeneration", "glaucoma", "keratitis", "dry_eye_disease", "corneal_dystrophies", "myopia", "peripheral_retinal_degenerations", "retinal_detachment"], "brief_title": "Efficacy And Safety of Pneumatic Trabeculoplasty", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate prospectively the PNT safety and efficacy in term of\r\n      IOP reduction in a group of previously or newly diagnosed glaucomatous subjects.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      A group of subjects affected by Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) underwent 3 PNT treatments\r\n      to evaluate one-year efficacy in term of IOP reduction and one-year safety in term of\r\n      incidence of adverse events\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01592955", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["refractory_glaucoma", "hg"], "exclusion": ["tension_glaucoma", "glaucoma", "ocular_or_retrobulbar_tumor", "ocular_infection", "aphakic", "ocular_disease", "choroidal_hemorrhage_or_detachment", "lens_subluxation", "thyroid_ophthalmopathy", "diabetic_retinopathy", "macular_edema"], "brief_title": "Glaucoma Treatment by Cyclo-coagulation Using High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU)", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and the safety of the\r\n      cyclocoagulation using High Intensity Focused Ulatrsound with the EYEOP1 device in glaucoma\r\n      patients\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT03138928", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": 80.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open-angle_glaucoma", "pseudoexfoliative_glaucoma", "pigmentary_glaucoma", "visual_field_damage", "glaucomatous", "glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["closed-angle_glaucoma", "uveitis", "corneal_disease"], "brief_title": "An Innovation in Glaucoma Surgery: XEN45 Gel Stent Implantation", "brief_summary": "\n      Purpose: To report the follow-up data for patients who had XEN45 gel stent implantation, a\r\n      new method of minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS).\r\n\r\n      Material and Methods: Fifteen eyes of fifteen patients who had XEN45 gel stent implantation\r\n      surgery were investigated in the study.

Increased\r\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for the development of optic\r\n      nerve damage and changes in the visual field. Therefore, the most effective treatment\r\n      modality is the reduction of IOP, in order to prevent glaucoma progression and optic nerve\r\n      atrophy. Trabeculectomy and episcleral aqueous drainage implants are currently the most\r\n      widely used surgical methods for reducing IOP and treating glaucoma. Unfortunately, these\r\n      procedures have potentially destructive intraoperative and postoperative complications, such\r\n      as hypotony, choroidal effusion, blebitis, and endophthalmitis. Therefore, there is a trend\r\n      of developing new surgical procedures to avoid the complications arising from conventional\r\n      surgical procedures. These new surgical methods, called \"minimally invasive glaucoma surgery\"\r\n      (MIGS), have some advantages over the conventional glaucoma surgical procedures, such as ab\r\n      interno applicability, the elimination of external intervention requirements, and the ease of\r\n      performance alongside cataract surgery. These advantages allow MIGS methods to be safer and\r\n      less invasive than other surgical methods.\r\n\r\n      The XEN gel stent (Allergan, Dublin, Ireland) is a recently developed, permanent, ab interno\r\n      collagen implant that reduces IOP by draining aqueous fluid from the anterior chamber into\r\n      the subconjunctival space. The stent is a hydrophilic tube that is 6 mm long and composed of\r\n      porcine gelatin crosslinked with glutaraldehyde. There are three sizes of this stent: 45 \u03bcm,\r\n      63 \u03bcm, and 140 \u03bcm, all with different inner diameters. The XEN45 gel stent is CE-marked in\r\n      the European Union, and it is indicated for the treatment of refractory glaucoma that has\r\n      proven resistant to previous surgical treatment and for patients with primary open angle\r\n      glaucoma (POAG), pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or pigmentary glaucoma that cannot be controlled\r\n      with the maximum tolerated medical therapy. It is also licensed for use in Canada,\r\n      Switzerland, and Turkey. The XEN45 gel stent was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\r\n      Administration (FDA). Because it is a new device, there are still unknown aspects of its\r\n      efficacy and safety and of the proper surgical technique for its use. This study aimed to\r\n      report the follow-up data after XEN45 gel stent implantation surgery in patients with\r\n      different types of glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Methods\r\n\r\n      This was a retrospective, consecutive case series study. Patients who had an XEN45 gel stent\r\n      implantation surgery between January 2015 and March 2016 were enrolled in the study. Patients\r\n      were included whose refractory glaucoma was resistant to previous surgical treatment.\r\n      Patients were also included who had POAG, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or pigmentary glaucoma,\r\n      with uncontrolled IOP and progressive visual field damage despite using the maximum tolerated\r\n      dose of topical antiglaucomatous medications. Patients who had previous glaucoma surgery were\r\n      included as well. The exclusion criteria included primary closed-angle glaucoma, a history of\r\n      uveitis, and the presence of corneal disease. Patients who did not attend follow-up visits\r\n      were also excluded. All patients were informed about the treatment and the potential\r\n      complications. Informed patient consents were obtained preoperatively. The procedures of the\r\n      study were approved by the institutional review board of the hospital and adhered to the\r\n      tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics\r\n      committee (approval code: TUTF-BAEK 2016/213).\r\n\r\n      Before the XEN45 implantation, slit-lamp biomicroscopy and gonioscopic examination were\r\n      performed. Intraocular pressure was measured by Goldmann applanation tonometry (AT 900, Haag\r\n      Strait, Bern, Germany). A detailed fundus examination was done using a 78-dioptre non-contact\r\n      lens after pupil dilatation by 1% tropicamide gutt.\r\n\r\n      All of the surgical procedures were performed under sterile conditions by the same surgeon\r\n      (OK). Irrigation of the eyelashes, eyelids, and periorbicular tissues was performed with\r\n      antiseptic 10% povidone iodine. While using an eye speculum, 5% povidone iodine was flushed\r\n      onto the conjunctiva and fornix for two minutes; conjunctival irrigation was then completed\r\n      with saline. The surgery was performed under peribulbar anaesthesia with 5 mL prilocaine and\r\n      5 mL bupivacaine. After peribulbar anaesthesia, the superonasal quadrant of the conjunctiva\r\n      was marked by blue surgical dye 3 mm posterior to the limbus. Clear corneal incisions (main\r\n      and side-port) were created in the inferotemporal and superotemporal quadrants; a highly\r\n      cohesive viscoelastic was used to stabilise the anterior chamber during surgery. A 27-gauge\r\n      pre-loaded injector was placed into the eye through the main clear corneal incision at the\r\n      inferotemporal quadrant. The needle was directed toward the superonasal quadrant (Figure 3).\r\n      One hand was used to manipulate the injector, and the other hand was used to fix and rotate\r\n      the eye. The needle was pushed into the sclera and carried forward into the subconjunctival\r\n      space. The surgery was performed under gonioscopic control. A 6-mm-long implant was created\r\n      to be positioned 2 mm into the subconjunctival space, 3 mm into the sclera, and 1 mm into the\r\n      anterior chamber. Therefore, visualization of the tip of the needle exiting from the sclera\r\n      indicated that an optimal 3-mm intrascleral tunnel had been formed. The XEN45 implant was\r\n      deployed by rotating a dial on the inserter. Once bleb formation was seen, the needle was\r\n      withdrawn. The viscoelastic material was aspirated, and then 0.1 ml of 1% cefuroxime was\r\n      injected into the anterior chamber. Finally, the clear corneal incisions were hydrated with a\r\n      balanced salt solution. Mitomycin C was not injected into the conjunctiva at any stage of the\r\n      surgery. Topical steroid and antibiotic treatments were applied after the surgery. A topical\r\n      steroid (prednisolone acetate 1%) was applied six or more times daily to control\r\n      postoperative intraocular inflammation. The topical steroid treatment was stopped after the\r\n      first month postoperative. Ocular massage for one minute four times daily was recommended\r\n      during the postoperative period. Needling was not performed at any of the postoperative\r\n      visits. Topical antiglaucomatous medications were added as needed according to the\r\n      postoperative IOP levels. Follow-up visits were planned for 1 day, 1 and 2 weeks, and 1, 2,\r\n      3, 6, and 12 months.\r\n\r\n      Combined surgery (XEN45 + phacoemulsification + intraocular lens) was performed in the cases\r\n      that had cataracts in addition to glaucoma. In combined surgery, the XEN45 implantation was\r\n      performed after the phacoemulsification. After the intraocular lens implantation in the\r\n      capsular sac, the anterior chamber was filled with a highly cohesive viscoelastic material.\r\n      Then, the same procedures as were described previously were carried out.\r\n\r\n      All the data were compiled into a computer file for statistical analysis, and Statistical\r\n      Package for Social Sciences for Windows 17.0 was used to perform the Wilcoxon signed ranks\r\n      test.

It is estimated that greater than 4.3\r\n      million Americans will have glaucoma in 2030. The treatment options are topical medications,\r\n      laser surgery, and incisional surgery. The goal of therapy is to lower intraocular pressure\r\n      (IOP). Despite adequate lowering of IOP, many patients continue to lose vision due to\r\n      progressive glaucomatous optic atrophy. This is likely related to the poor understanding of\r\n      glaucoma pathogenesis. There are two theories which explain the mechanism of primary open\r\n      angle glaucoma (POAG). The mechanical theory posits that intraocular pressure (IOP) can\r\n      produce optic nerve damage through biomechanical or structural factors. All current\r\n      therapeutic interventions are aimed at this particular mechanism. The vascular theory\r\n      suggests that compromise of the optic nerve microvasculature induces glaucomatous optic nerve\r\n      damage. There is a significant body of literature supporting the role of ocular hemodynamic\r\n      (OHD) changes in the development and progression of glaucoma. However, there have been\r\n      limited investigations of the effect of surgical interventions on OHD. This is primarily due\r\n      to a lack of non-invasive, cost-effective methods of assessing OHD factors. Today, the\r\n      technology exists to assess these factors in such a manner. Thus, the purpose of this study\r\n      is to assess the response of OHD factors to surgical intervention in glaucoma patients.\r\n      Participants: Seventy-five participants with varying degrees of open angle glaucoma (OAG)\r\n      that meet clinical criteria for cataract or glaucoma surgery will be recruited from the\r\n      glaucoma clinics at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Kittner Eye Center. Once they have\r\n      been determined to be eligible, they will be assigned to one of three groups based upon\r\n      surgical indication. Group 1 is cataract surgery only. Group 2 is cataract surgery with\r\n      iStent (Glaukos Corp., Laguna Hills, CA) implantation. Group 3 is implantation of a glaucoma\r\n      drainage device.

This increase is projected to be 15% in Europe, 33% in North America, 74% in\r\n      South East Asia and 143% in Africa from 2019 to 2045. About 3 in 5 participants who have\r\n      diabetes in Africa remain undiagnosed. Whereas the total diabetes related health expenditure\r\n      is 494 billion USD in high income countries, and 264 billion USD in middle income countries,\r\n      low income countries expend only 1 billion USD. Therefore, diabetes is a huge problem\r\n      worldwide especially in low income countries.\r\n\r\n      Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication of diabetes which leads to\r\n      blindness if left untreated. Diabetic retinopathy is one of the leading causes of blindness\r\n      especially among the working group when vision is very important for daily living. Diabetic\r\n      retinopathy is identified in a third of diabetic patients.\r\n\r\n      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) however can be treated effectively but early detection and timely\r\n      referrals are essential for successful outcomes. Early diagnosis, timely referrals and access\r\n      to treatment through a comprehensive and systematic surveillance of the diabetic population\r\n      has been shown to be clinically effective and cost effective. The United Kingdom (UK) has a\r\n      national population based diabetic retinopathy screening programme which has been very\r\n      successful. These screening programmes are non-existent or inadequately developed in many\r\n      resource constrained settings. A study was recently concluded in Vietnam in which\r\n      non-physician graders were trained to screen for diabetic retinopathy among the population of\r\n      diabetic patients. The study also assessed the accuracy of DR grading among medical graders\r\n      versus non-physician graders in Vietnam.\r\n\r\n      The aim of this current study is to develop and test a low cost opportunistic glaucoma\r\n      screening model during diabetic retinopathy screening using the same non physician graders\r\n      currently used in the recently concluded diabetic retinopathy (DR) study.\r\n\r\n      Introduction\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic optic nerve changes and\r\n      functional visual field defects which in part is related to a raised intraocular pressure\r\n      (IOP). The disease is characterized by typical pattern of damage to the optic nerve, loss of\r\n      retinal ganglion cells, and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Glaucoma can be\r\n      divided into two main types based on the morphology of the anterior chamber angle: there is\r\n      the open angle and the angle closure glaucoma. These two types of glaucoma have different\r\n      risk factors, different natural histories and different management. There are other forms of\r\n      classification which include primary and secondary glaucomas depending on the etiology of the\r\n      glaucoma. Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. An estimated 60.5\r\n      million persons were said to be affected by glaucoma in 2010. Glaucoma is a huge problem\r\n      worldwide especially in developing countries. The disease however can be managed with\r\n      medical, laser, and surgical forms of treatment. Reduction of intraocular pressure by 30-50%\r\n      from baseline usually stops progression of the disease.\r\n\r\n      It has been reported that the increasing life expectancy especially of Asians and Africans\r\n      may lead to an increase in the prevalence of glaucoma by 74% from 2013 to 2040. It is\r\n      projected that the prevalence of glaucoma will increase from 64.3 million to 111.8 million in\r\n      2040, and that glaucoma will disproportionately affect people residing in Africa and Asia.\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma often progresses unnoticed by the patient until central visual acuity is affected,\r\n      therefore early detection of the disease is important before symptoms develop. The rate of\r\n      undiagnosed disease however is quite high in developing countries with a large proportion not\r\n      being aware of the disease. It is estimated that about 95% are not aware of their glaucoma in\r\n      developing countries while 50% are unaware of the disease in developed countries. Early\r\n      detection of glaucoma requires some form of screening. Screening of any disease is a form of\r\n      secondary prevention and the goal is often to prevent undesired outcomes. In the context of\r\n      glaucoma, screening helps to diagnose it in the asymptomatic stage so that treatment can be\r\n      started earlier to slow down or prevent progression of the disease to blindness. In a recent\r\n      study on the burden of undetected untreated glaucoma in the United States, it was reported\r\n      that the odds of having undiagnosed glaucoma was highest among blacks with a 4.4 times\r\n      greater odds compared with Caucasians. This disparity was attributed to uneven access to\r\n      health care by blacks. One way to alleviate this is to conduct population based screening for\r\n      glaucoma. But this has not been found to be cost effective in developed countries.\r\n\r\n      In a very recent study published in the Lancet Global Health, however, population screening\r\n      was reported to be cost effective in China. In a study on the cost effectiveness of community\r\n      screening for glaucoma in rural India, it was reported that community screening would prevent\r\n      2,190 person years blindness over a 10 year period. It was concluded that community\r\n      population screening may be cost effective if targeted at 40-69 years' age group and if\r\n      implemented in urban areas. A study in China recently demonstrated using a decision analytic\r\n      Markov model that population screening for both primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and\r\n      primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) was cost effective in both rural and urban China.\r\n\r\n      It is possible that screening of two major blinding eye diseases (glaucoma and diabetic\r\n      retinopathy) using the same facilities is likely to be more cost effective. Opportunistic\r\n      glaucoma screening can be more cost effective especially when it is piggy bagged into another\r\n      screening programme. Diabetic retinopathy screening has been ongoing with the use of optic\r\n      nerve photos. It is possible to train the same non- physician graders who are currently\r\n      screening for diabetic retinopathy to also screen for glaucoma using the same facilities and\r\n      images.\r\n\r\n      The use of non-physician graders to conduct screening in low-resource settings is\r\n      particularly important as these are the group of health workers who have been trained to\r\n      screen for diabetes. In addition, it reduces the burden on scarce, highly-trained health care\r\n      providers in developing countries.\r\n\r\n      Study Aims:\r\n\r\n        -  To develop a training course for screening glaucoma using fundus images obtained during\r\n           diabetic retinopathy screening by non-physician graders.\r\n\r\n        -  To test this training course among non-physician graders in Vietnam\r\n\r\n      Main research question Can trained non-physician graders accurately screen for glaucoma\r\n      during diabetic retinopathy screening?\r\n\r\n      Methods\r\n\r\n      Study design: This is an uncontrolled interventional experimental before and after study in\r\n      which a minimum of 42 non-physician graders shall be trained to screen for glaucoma using\r\n      optic nerve photos obtained for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening in Vietnam.\r\n\r\n      The study flow will be as follows:\r\n\r\n        -  Non-physician graders are consented, enrolled and undergo testing on the standard image\r\n           set at baseline\r\n\r\n        -  The non-physician graders complete the training course.

Glaucoma is highly prevalent\r\n      in patients who require a KPro and even more after their procedure.\r\n\r\n      In order to decrease the intra-ocular pressure, surgeons can use multiple eyedrops.\r\n      Unfortunately, following the KPro surgery, eyedrops lose their efficiency because they are\r\n      less absorbed by the eye.\r\n\r\n      The transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TS-CPC) is a laser treatment used in advanced\r\n      refractory glaucoma. This laser helps decrease the intra-ocular pressure and have a better\r\n      control of the disease.

Indeed,\r\n      pathologies requiring a Boston keratoprosthesis and history of previous ocular surgeries are\r\n      themselves risk factors for glaucoma. Furthermore, the corneal opacity and irregularities\r\n      lead to poor visualization of the optic nerve and incorrect intra-ocular pressure (IOP)\r\n      measurements. Thus, the prevalence of glaucoma preoperatively is most likely underestimated.\r\n\r\n      Following the KPro, the increase of IOP or the new diagnosis of glaucoma is estimated between\r\n      8 and 35% per year. Additionally, the IOP cannot be determined by the traditional tonometry\r\n      and is estimated by digital palpation. This leads to treatment follow-up being difficult and\r\n      limited. For those reasons, it is suggested by experts to insert a glaucoma drainage device\r\n      during the Boston keratoprosthesis surgery for all patients.\r\n\r\n      In perspective, the transscleral cyclophotocoagulation (TS-CPC) is one of the\r\n      cyclodestructive procedures used for severe glaucoma. It leads to destruction of the ciliary\r\n      body epithelium and reduction of aqueous humour production which can reduce the IOP.\r\n\r\n      Different transmission techniques are available and include the Micropulse diode laser\r\n      (MP-TSCPC, IRIDEX IQ810 Laser systems, Mountain View, CA) and the semiconductor system with\r\n      the G-Probe (IRIS Oculight SLx, IRIS Medical Inc., Mountain View, CA).

Patients will be randomly assigned to either\r\n      one of the TS-CPC treatment (Micro-Pulse or G-Probe).\r\n\r\n      Following the KPro surgery, if any additional glaucoma surgery is necessary (including the\r\n      insertion of a glaucoma drainage device), these treatment options will be offered to the\r\n      participants, as per standard of care.\r\n\r\n      For more information regarding the intervention's arms, see the section below.\r\n\r\n      Control group- cohort study\r\n\r\n      A control group composed of a historical cohort of ten (10) patients who did not receive any\r\n      glaucoma surgery or TS-CPC 3 months before their Boston keratoprosthesis will be included in\r\n      the historical cohort.\r\n\r\n      Indeed, when reviewing the literature, given the high prevalence of glaucoma in this\r\n      population and the current recommendation of inserting a glaucoma drainage device (GDD) in\r\n      patients receiving a KPro, it would be ethically non-acceptable to have a prospective group\r\n      without any prophylactic treatment.

Furthermore, an optic\r\n      nerve optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed and two visual fields test\r\n      (SITA-Fast and Goldman) will be performed during the first and third month post-KPro.

Given that our\r\n      primary endpoint is a continuous variable, the investigators used a student t-test with a\r\n      power of 90%, an alpha of 0,05 and an effect size of 2,6. For the effect size, it was\r\n      determined based of a difference clinically significant of 20% with the progression of the\r\n      cup-to-disc ratio in KPro patients. Of note, this study only included the average and not the\r\n      standard of deviation. The investigators assumed that the standard of deviation increases\r\n      proportionally to the mean.\r\n\r\n      Statistical analysis Binary variable will be compared across the three groups using a chi\r\n      square test. For continuous variable, such as the cup-to-disc ratio progression and the\r\n      thinning of the Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL), an ANOVA test will be performed. A test\r\n      using an alpha parameter of 0,05 will be judged as clinically significant.\r\n\r\n      The visual acuity will be expressed in LogMar and its evolution will be compared across the\r\n      three groups. The investigators will compare the rate of no light perception (NLP) between\r\n      the three groups. Given that a previous study showed a 16% rate of NLP after 5 years. The\r\n      investigators will consider a difference of 5% as clinically significant.\r\n\r\n      A Kaplan-Meir survival curve will be performed for: (1) the loss of light perception and (2)\r\n      the need of a second intervention for glaucoma control. A Log-rank test will be performed to\r\n      determine if those variables are statistically different across the groups.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT02162043", "minimum_age": 20.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": [], "exclusion": [], "brief_title": "Development and Evaluation of a Self-administered/Assisted Visual Field Screening Tool for Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      This project aims to evaluate a self-administered screening test for glaucoma, the second\r\n      largest cause of blindness in the western world.

While glaucoma changes occur in both the retina\r\n      and the optic nerve head, clinical diagnosis normally focuses on optic nerve head. However,\r\n      histomorphologic and immunohistochemistry studies have shown that glial cells in the retina\r\n      (astrocytes and M\u00fcller cells) are also activated in glaucoma. In addition, some patients with\r\n      glaucoma have clinically patchy alteration in the retina resembling epiretinal gliosis but\r\n      without visual disturbance, thus the term \"gliosis-like alterations\" was used previously.

Although the pathogenesis of glaucoma after\r\n      cataract surgery remains unclear, several risk factors have been identified. These include\r\n      early surgery, chronic postoperative inflammation , primary posterior capsulotomy ,\r\n      persistence of fetal vasculature , and microphthalmia .\r\n\r\n      However, the pathogenesis of the classic, open-angle type of glaucoma that develops on\r\n      average 1.3-12.2 years following uneventful cataract surgery is still obscure. Mechanical\r\n      collapse of the trabecular meshwork due to the loss of ciliary body tension could be one of\r\n      the possible reasons. Some speculate that obstruction of the trabecular meshwork by\r\n      inflammatory cells, lens remnants and vitreous-derived factors may result in delayed\r\n      elevation in IOP. Arrest of postnatal angle maturation secondary to the surgical intervention\r\n      could be a contributing factor, especially that aphakic glaucoma is more likely to occur in\r\n      patients who had lensectomy at a younger age, usually the first year of life. The incidence\r\n      of secondary pediatric glaucoma after cataract surgery is not yet precisely identified. It\r\n      ranges from 3%-41% depending on the follow-up period and the criteria chosen to define\r\n      glaucoma . Management of paediatric glaucoma following cataract surgery (GFCS) is\r\n      challenging. Trabeculectomy has a poor success rate and precludes the use of contact lenses,\r\n      especially in the presence of thin, avascular, cystic blebs . Glaucoma drainage devices have\r\n      a higher chance of success than trabeculectomy, but aphakic eyes have relatively higher rates\r\n      of complications, especially suprachoroidal haemorrhage, if hypotony occurs particularly if\r\n      buphthalmic. GDD-implanted eyes also carry a life-long risk of developing keratopathy\r\n      secondary to endothelial decompensation from the tube end .Cyclodestructive procedures\r\n      provide a temporizing treatment with occasional longterm control after multiple treatments.\r\n      Yet, it is difficult to titrate with marked inflammation and a risk of phthisis, especially\r\n      in microphthalmic eyes. Furthermore, it may be associated with chronic hypotony and may\r\n      prejudice future surgery to failure. Angle surgery was first described as a surgical option\r\n      in GFCS by Chen et al., yielding promising results in terms of IOP lowering and surgical\r\n      success. Unlike bleb-based procedures, angle surgery addresses the more physiological outflow\r\n      pathway through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal. Hence the risk of bleb-based\r\n      complications such as infection, bleb leak, overfiltration and bleb dysthesia is reduced.\r\n      With the growing evidence that circumferential trabeculotomy yields superior results to\r\n      conventional 180\u00b0 angle surgery in primary congenital glaucoma16, Freedman et al.\r\n      retrospectively reported the results of microcatheter-assisted circumferential trabeculotomy\r\n      in GFCS, achieving a 72% success rate. several reports in treatment of pediatric glaucoma\r\n      have concluded that the use of viscoelastic materials during trabeculotomy may increase the\r\n      success rate of the procedure by preventing ocular decompression, postoperative hemorrhage,\r\n      anterior chamber shallowness, and adhesion of the incision lips or fibroblastic\r\n      proliferation18.The purpose of the present study was to compare outcomes of single-site rigid\r\n      probe viscotrabeculotomy (VT) Versus two-site VT in pediatric secondary glaucoma following\r\n      cataract surgery.\r\n\r\n      Patients and methods:\r\n\r\n      This is a comparative study , performed on patients aged \u2264 12 years and required surgery for\r\n      glaucoma following congenital cataract surgery (GFCS) with or without intraocular lens (IOL)\r\n      implantation.

Glaucoma and ocular hypertension are chronic eye diseases that can\r\n      damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss or blindness. The optic nerve acts like an\r\n      electric cable with over a million wires. This nerve is responsible for carrying images from\r\n      the eye to the brain. The way glaucoma and ocular hypertension cause blindness depends on\r\n      many factors, but the most important factor is the increased pressure inside the eye\r\n      (intraocular pressure).\r\n\r\n      There is no cure for glaucoma or ocular hypertension. However, lowering the pressure inside\r\n      the eye has been shown to slow the progression of disease. Intraocular pressure can be\r\n      lowered by glaucoma medication, laser treatment, or surgery.\r\n\r\n      You have open angle glaucoma, pseudoexfoliative glaucoma, or ocular hypertension. Researchers\r\n      want to find out more about how 2 drugs called Cosopt (dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol\r\n      maleate) and Xalatan (latanoprost) can help people with these conditions.\r\n\r\n      Cosopt and Xalatan are both eye drops that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\r\n      Administration (FDA) to reduce intraocular pressure in people with open angle glaucoma and\r\n      ocular hypertension.\r\n\r\n      The study doctor will do a laser procedure called Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT) on\r\n      people in this study to help lower their intraocular pressure. The FDA has approved SLT to\r\n      treat open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.\r\n\r\n      Then the study doctor will ask some participants to use either Cosopt or Xalatan, if their\r\n      intraocular pressure is still too high 4 to 6 weeks after the SLT procedure. The study doctor\r\n      wants to see which of the 2 study drugs (Cosopt or Xalatan) is better at reducing intraocular\r\n      pressure after SLT.\r\n\r\n      It is planned that about 30 people with glaucoma or ocular hypertension who are at least 18\r\n      years old will be in this study. Out of the participants whose intraocular pressure is still\r\n      too high after SLT, half will use Cosopt and half will use Xalatan. You do not have to be in\r\n      this study to have SLT or to use Cosopt or Xalatan.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Introduction Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty has been shown as a relatively safe and\r\n      effective treatment modality for lowering IOP in various forms of open-angle glaucoma (Latina\r\n      et al). It lowers IOP by increasing aqueous outflow through its effect at cellular level\r\n      possibly either (1) through migration and phagocytosis of trabecular meshwork debris by\r\n      macrophages or (2) by stimulating the proliferation of healthy trabecular and endothelial\r\n      cells.\r\n\r\n      Cases who don't achieve target IOP following SLT therapy need additional treatment in form of\r\n      topical medications. Conventionally common topical antiglaucoma medications to treat glaucoma\r\n      after SLT therapy either suppress aqueous secretion (B-blockers or carbonic anhydrase\r\n      inhibitors) or enhances uveoscleral aqueous outflow (Prostaglandin analogues). Since\r\n      Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty acts on outflow pathway, further additional IOP reduction can\r\n      be achieved more effectively by a class of drug which acts on different pathway; on aqueous\r\n      secretion by aqueous suppressants like Cosopt. In contrast drugs acting on outflow pathway\r\n      like prostaglandin analogue ( Xalatan etc) will possibly be less additive in further reducing\r\n      IOP after SLT since SLT also has effect on the same pathway- outflow pathway.\r\n\r\n      Previous studies (Fechtner et al. J Ocul Pharmacol Ther. 2005 Jun;21(3):242-9 and Fechtner et\r\n      al.

But to our knowledge, no long term\r\n      prospective study has evaluated aqueous suppressants (Cosopt) and prostaglandin analogues\r\n      with respect to their comparative efficacy in treatment of uncontrolled glaucoma status post\r\n      SLT therapy.\r\n\r\n      OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study is to compare the IOP lowering efficacy of\r\n      aqueous suppressants (Cosopt) and prostaglandin analogues (Xalatan) when used status post SLT\r\n      in the management of Open Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension.\r\n\r\n      INCLUSION CRITERIA 1.

Glaucoma can cause irreversible visual impairment. Current treatment modalities\r\n      only halt disease progression and do not improve visual function. It is important to\r\n      understand that poor visual function can have major consequences to an individual's\r\n      day-to-day tasks such as increased risk of falls and automobile accidents.\r\n\r\n      Disability glare is commonly experienced by eye disease patients, including those with\r\n      glaucoma, and has been shown to be present even in those who are mildly affected by the\r\n      disease. MP is a blue-light filter that plays an important role in visual performance\r\n      including glare sensitivity. Moreover, MP is a potent antioxidant, and it is widely known\r\n      that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, both at the level of\r\n      retinal ganglion cells and trabecular meshwork.\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma and cognitive decline are both neurodegenerative processes that share several\r\n      antecedents. The clustering of degenerative disorders towards the end of life is thought to\r\n      be the result of cumulative and lifelong oxidative injury, and is consistent with the free\r\n      radical theory of aging.

The prevalence of bleb leaks, bleb-related\r\n      infections, and bleb dysesthesia associated with a perilimbal filtering bleb suggests the\r\n      need to consider alternatives. Tube shunts (or glaucoma drainage implants) offer an\r\n      alternative to trabeculectomy in the surgical management of glaucoma, and these devices have\r\n      been growing in popularity in recent years.\r\n\r\n      Practice patterns vary in the surgical management of glaucoma in eyes with previous ocular\r\n      surgery. In 1996, Chen and colleagues conducted an anonymous survey of members of the\r\n      American Glaucoma Society (AGS) and Japanese Glaucoma Society (JGS) to evaluate use of\r\n      antifibrotic agents and tube shunts. The survey presented ten clinical situations requiring\r\n      glaucoma surgical intervention. The majority of respondents (59-83%) preferred trabeculectomy\r\n      with MMC for the clinical scenarios involving prior ocular surgery, although many of those\r\n      surveyed elected to use a tube shunt, trabeculectomy with 5-FU, or trabeculectomy without an\r\n      antifibrotic agent. In 2002, Joshi and associates re-administered the same survey to members\r\n      of the AGS. Respondents still favored trabeculectomy with MMC, but the percentage usage of\r\n      tube shunts had significantly increased. The greatest practice pattern shift was observed in\r\n      patients with previous cataract and glaucoma surgery. In particular, selection of tube shunts\r\n      as the preferred surgical approach increased from 7% to 22% in eyes with prior\r\n      trabeculectomy, and increased from 8% to 22% in eyes with prior extracapsular or\r\n      intracapsular cataract extraction.\r\n\r\n      The lack of consensus among glaucoma surgeons regarding the use of tube shunts or\r\n      trabeculectomy with an antifibrotic agent in eyes that have had prior cataract or glaucoma\r\n      surgery likely relates to the fact that available clinical data has not shown one surgical\r\n      procedure to be superior to the other. Similar surgical results have been reported with both\r\n      glaucoma procedures in eyes with aphakia/pseudophakia and failed filters when studied\r\n      separately. Success rates have ranged from 50% to 88% for tube shunts, and 48% to 86% for\r\n      filtering surgery with an antifibrotic agent in case series studying aphakic/pseudophakic\r\n      eyes. Success rates have ranged from 44% to 88% for tube shunts, and 61% to 100% for 5-FU and\r\n      MMC trabeculectomy in eyes with failed filters. Comparable rates of severe complications have\r\n      also been reported with tube shunt surgery and trabeculectomy with an adjunctive antifibrotic\r\n      agent.\r\n\r\n      The Tube Versus Trabeculectomy (TVT) Study was designed to prospectively compare the safety\r\n      and efficacy of nonvalved tube shunt surgery and trabeculectomy with MMC. Patients with\r\n      uncontrolled glaucoma who had prior cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation\r\n      and/or failed filtering surgery were enrolled in this multicenter clinical trial and\r\n      randomized to placement of a 350 Baerveldt glaucoma implant (Advanced Medical Optics, Irvine,\r\n      CA) or trabeculectomy with MMC (0.4 mg/ml for 4 minutes). The goal of this investigator\r\n      initiated trial is to provide information that will assist in surgical decision-making in\r\n      similar patient groups.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT03374553", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": [], "exclusion": ["neovascular_glaucoma", "corneal_disease"], "brief_title": "MINIject 636 in Patients With Open Angle Glaucoma Uncontrolled by Topical Hypotensive Medications", "brief_summary": "\n      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MINIject 636 and IOP lowering effects with\r\n      or without glaucoma medications.

They developed a\r\n      simple model estimating the number of glaucoma blind people in each World Bank region.\r\n      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) was judged to be responsible for three million blind,\r\n      primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) for two million, and for congenital glaucoma the figure\r\n      was 200 000, giving a total of 5.2 million blind. This represents 15% of global blindness.\r\n      The number of people affected by glaucoma was estimated to be about 20 million.\r\n\r\n      In 1996, Quigley used 111 published reports of glaucoma prevalence to construct a statistical\r\n      model of the number of people affected by glaucoma worldwide (2). Data were included only if\r\n      the study design, methods, and reported results met certain specific criteria. The countries\r\n      of the world were arranged in seven groups according to similarities in ethnicity and\r\n      presumed characteristics of glaucoma. For each region, the available age specific prevalence\r\n      of OAG and ACG were applied to population projections for the year 2000. It was estimated\r\n      that 66.8 million people were affected by OAG and ACG, with nearly equal numbers of people\r\n      affected by each disease. Few prevalence studies described secondary glaucoma separately, but\r\n      an estimate of six million for secondary glaucoma was reached, making a total, without\r\n      childhood glaucoma, of around 73 million affected. Of these, 6.7 million were thought to be\r\n      blind (2).\r\n\r\n      There was reliable epidemiologic evidence to suggest that PACG is more common among Eskimos\r\n      (3) and Chinese (4). As POAG was common in the western countries, there was a large\r\n      population at risk in Asia (5). PACG among Asians was more frequently chronic and has few\r\n      symptoms (6). Therefore, persons might not be motivated by symptoms to present to medical\r\n      attention until significant visual damage has occurred in this region. A population-based\r\n      study of screening techniques for PACG was performed in the township of Jin Shan in rural\r\n      Taiwan (7). This joint US-Taiwanese project, published in 1996, identified a target\r\n      population of 5441 people aged 40 years and older, of whom 562 were examined. A gonioscopic\r\n      examination was carried out on all subjects. PACG was diagnosed in people with a \"narrow\"\r\n      angle and either an IOP >18 mm Hg, an increase in IOP 8 mm Hg on dark prone provocation test,\r\n      or a previous \"acute\" episode of angle closure with an iridectomy. The diagnosis did not\r\n      depend on the presence of a visual field defect or structural optic neuropathy. There were 17\r\n      people diagnosed as suffering PACG (3.0%). Only 35% of cases gave a history of symptoms\r\n      characteristic of \"acute\" angle closure. Two of these 17 people (12%) were blind in both eyes\r\n      (7). As aforementioned, Taiwan has a high prevalence of PACG, which usually leads to\r\n      blindness ultimately. There are many reported studies on genes of POAG and normal-tension\r\n      glaucoma from Asia, including Japan (14,21,29), China (25), and Korea (24). However, studies\r\n      about genetics of PACG were lacking. Hence, in this study, we use the model of genomewide\r\n      microsatellite genotyping with method of linkage disequilibrium to study the possible\r\n      candidate gene of PACG. Then, we will further sequence the cDNA forPAX6 to find out the\r\n      possible mutation in the family with well-defined pedigree.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01668524", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["open_angle_glaucoma", "ocular_hypertension", "ocular_hypotensive"], "exclusion": ["glaucoma", "steroid", "pigment_dispersion_glaucoma", "angle_closure", "cataract", "ocular_infection", "inflammation", "blepharitis", "dermatitis", "uveitis", "conjunctivitis", "corneal_dystrophy", "epithelial_and_or_endothelial_disease", "corneal_irregularities", "ocular_disease", "macular_degeneration"], "brief_title": "ATS907 Ph2a Open-Label Dose-ranging Safety and Tolerability in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) and Ocular Hypertension (OHT) Subjects", "brief_summary": "\n      This single-site, dose-escalation study will evaluate safety and tolerability of increasing\r\n      concentrations of ATS907 in 12 subjects with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma and/or Ocular\r\n      Hypertension\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT00705770", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["hypotensive"], "exclusion": ["visual_field_loss", "glaucoma"], "brief_title": "A Multi-Dose Study With a Treatment for Open-Angle Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Anecortave Acetate is effective for\r\n      lowering intraocular pressure caused by open-angle glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT00219596", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["open-angle_glaucoma", "ocular_hypertension"], "exclusion": ["glaucoma"], "brief_title": "Xalacom And Combination Of Unfixed Latanoprost And Timolol In Subjects With Open-Angle Glaucoma Or Ocular Hypertension", "brief_summary": "\n      to compare efficacy and safety of Xalacom with the combination of unfixed Latanoprost and\r\n      Timolol in subjects with open-angel glaucoma or ocular hypertension\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT05205122", "minimum_age": 0.0027397260273972603, "maximium_age": 3.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["epiphora", "photophobia", "blepharospasm"], "exclusion": ["secondary_glaucoma_glaucoma", "congenital_anomalies"], "brief_title": "Evaluation of Primary Congenital Glaucoma at Asyut University Hospital", "brief_summary": "\n      Evaluation of the management of primary congenital glaucoma regarding the results of surgical\r\n      intervention at Asyut University Hospital\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT04157530", "minimum_age": 20.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["ocular_hypotensive", "eye_diseases"], "exclusion": ["diabetes", "myopia", "allergic", "mental_illness"], "brief_title": "Clinical Evaluation of Acupuncture in Treating Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      The present study predicts that acupuncture or electroacupuncture can reduce intraocular\r\n      pressure and also can improve quality of life in patients with glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Glaucoma is a syndrome, and that is results from intraocular pressure increases cause visual\r\n      field narrow and blindness.

The score ranges\r\n           from 0 to 16. In the odor-discrimination test, the patient has to determine which of the\r\n           three presented pens smell differently. A total of 16 triplets is presented to the\r\n           patient, and thus the score ranges from 0 to 16.

Such implants\r\n      drain the aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye to a plate positioned above the\r\n      sclera, between the rectus muscles. The aqueous humor goes through the pseudocyst that forms\r\n      around the plate by passive diffusion and is drained by the venous capillaries and lymphatic\r\n      system.\r\n\r\n      The Ahmed drainage implant (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA) is a device\r\n      with flow restrictors, which decreases the incidence of postoperative complications such as\r\n      hypotony (2-3). It is made of silicone and comes in two sizes. The FP7 model has a surface of\r\n      184 mm2, 13mm wide and 16mm long. The FP8 model presents 96mm2 surface, 9.6 mm wide and 10mm\r\n      long.\r\n\r\n      Studies in animals and adult humans suggest that the surface area of the implant plate is\r\n      directly related to the amount of aqueous fluid drained through the same (4-7). In contrast,\r\n      a very large implant can result in the extrusion of the same, uncontrolled intraocular\r\n      pressure, corneal injury by endothelial touch, patient discomfort and ocular motility\r\n      problems. The use of pediatric size implants in small eyes can avoid such complications. A\r\n      high rate (34.8%) of anterior plate of the tubes in children under 2 years of age has been\r\n      reported (8-9). On the other hand, the use of pediatric implante may affect the control of\r\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) due to reduced drainage area (10), especially in eyes with\r\n      increasing axial diameter, a result of increased eye pressure that happens in children with\r\n      glaucoma. However, there is no study in the literature comparing different sizes of drainage\r\n      implants in pediatric patients.\r\n\r\n      A study to compare the success rates and complications between FP7 and FP8 models is\r\n      essential in order to standardize a conduct in choosing the type of implant. Currently, the\r\n      choice of the drainage implant model to be used in every child lies on the free choice and\r\n      personal preference of the surgeon. There is no standard procedure, based on scientific\r\n      evidence for this choice.\r\n\r\n      OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\n      Compare the success rates and complications of two models of Ahmed drainage implant (FP7 and\r\n      FP8) in patients with pediatric glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      MATERIALS AND METHODS\r\n\r\n      This clinical trial is a prospective, randomized, masked to the evaluator to be held at the\r\n      Department of Ophthalmology, Federal University of Sao Paulo.\r\n\r\n      Will be included children between 0 and 10 years of age with glaucoma and surgical indication\r\n      for glaucoma drainage implant. Surgical indication for implantation of Ahmed drainage occurs\r\n      in some situations: 1) children with primary congenital glaucoma that undergone angular\r\n      surgery (goniotomy and / or trabeculotomy) who did not respond satisfactorily to surgery, 2)\r\n      children with glaucoma secondary to aphakia who have the primary indication for implantation\r\n      of Ahmed drainage, 3) children with glaucoma secondary to other eye disorders where medical\r\n      treatment is not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n      A term of consent will be obtained from parents or legal guardians of the child, in which all\r\n      the risks inherent to the surgical procedure will be clarified. Such risks are proper to\r\n      antiglaucomatous surgery are:\r\n\r\n        1. Early: hypotony, hyphema, tube endothelial touch, choroidal detachment, leakage of\r\n           aqueous, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, loss of light perception\r\n\r\n        2. late: uncontrolled intraocular pressure, persistent hypotony, scleral patch resorption,\r\n           extrusion of the tube, retinal detachment, loss of light perception (11-18).\r\n\r\n      Considering that the selected patient has already the surgical indication for Ahmed drainage\r\n      implant, the inclusion of this child in the study does not bring additional risks or\r\n      discomforts to the same.\r\n\r\n      The model of the drainage implant will be chosen through allocation from a computer-generated\r\n      random table.\r\n\r\n      Children enrolled in the study will be divided into two groups (one group will receive the\r\n      model FP7 and another group will receive the model FP8) with the number of 20 participants in\r\n      each group, totaling 40 children.\r\n\r\n      The surgeries will be performed by experienced surgeons from Glaucoma Sector from Department\r\n      of Ophthalmology, Federal University of Sao Paulo.\r\n\r\n      The plate of the Ahmed drainage implant will be placed in one of the quadrants selected from\r\n      the extraocular muscles between 8 and 10 mm away from the corneal limbus. The tube will have\r\n      its distal portion inserted 2-3mm into the anterior chamber of the eye in the iris plane. The\r\n      exposed portion of the tube is covered with donor sclera.\r\n\r\n      The children included in the study will be examined before surgery, which will be measured\r\n      your visual acuity, biomicroscopy, IOP, Retinography and axial length of the eye. Immediately\r\n      after surgery, with a compass we will measure the distance between the plate of drainage\r\n      implant and corneal limbus.\r\n\r\n      Children will be examined again after 6 months and 1 year of surgery. We will perform the\r\n      measurement of visual acuity, biomicroscopy, IOP, Retinography, axial length and measurement\r\n      of the distance from the plate of the implant and corneal limbus. Post-operative examinations\r\n      will be performed under narcosis, in hospitals (when it is impossible to take measures in an\r\n      outpatient setting due to lack of cooperation of the child), by a doctor from congenital\r\n      glaucoma sector who were not involved in the surgical procedure. The examination under\r\n      narcosis involves risk to the child, which include cough, nausea, vomiting, laryngospasm,\r\n      bronchospasm, apnea, bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, anxiety (19-21).\r\n\r\n      Two types of outcome will be considered in this study. The primary endpoint is to evaluate\r\n      the position of the drainage implant plate and if the plate is positioned at a distance \u2265 8\r\n      mm from the corneal limbus after 1 year of surgery, considered successful. If the dish drain\r\n      implant is positioned at a distance <8 mm from the corneal limbus, we have a failure.\r\n\r\n      As a secondary outcome, we evaluate the variation in IOP preoperative and postoperative. We\r\n      will use as a criterion of success an IOP \u2264 21 mm Hg and> 5 mmHg and a 30% reduction of\r\n      preoperative IOP. If the patient meets these criteria, without the use of eyedrop, classified\r\n      as complete success. If the use of eyedrop is necessary to meet the criteria, a qualified\r\n      success will be defined.\r\n\r\n      For failure criterion is assumed: IOP \u2264 5 mmHg or > 21 mm Hg, even with the use of eye drops,\r\n      need for further surgery, and / or loss of light perception.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT02917564", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucoma", "5-fu"], "exclusion": ["choroidal_hemorrhage", "infection", "triamcinolone"], "brief_title": "Triamcinolone Injections for Persistent Choroidal Effusions Post Glaucoma Surgery", "brief_summary": "\n      During glaucoma surgery, a new opening is created that allows fluid to drain out of the eye,\r\n      bypassing the clogged drainage channels that are malfunctioning in patients with glaucoma. In\r\n      some patients who have had glaucoma surgery too much fluid flows out and this results in a\r\n      pressure that is too low. This may cause swelling of one layer at the back of the eye called\r\n      the choroid.

The only effective\r\n      treatment currently involves lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) by medical, laser, or\r\n      surgical techniques. Glaucoma surgery is indicated when further IOP lowering is needed\r\n      despite maximal medical therapy and appropriate laser treatment.\r\n\r\n      The choroid is a pigmented and vascular structure located between the sclera and retinal\r\n      pigmented epithelium.\r\n\r\n      Choroidal effusions are aberrant collections of fluid within the suprachoroidal potential\r\n      space. There are two types of choroidal effusion, serous and hemorrhagic, depending on the\r\n      type of fluid that accumulates in the suprachoroidal space. A serous choroidal effusion is\r\n      composed of a transudate fluid from increased transmural pressure across the capillaries.\r\n      Their development is usually relatively painless. Hemorrhagic choroidal effusion or\r\n      suprachoroidal haemorrhage is a sudden and usually very painful accumulation of blood in the\r\n      suprachoroidal space. 4 Choroidal effusions can be caused by both low IOP and\r\n      pro-inflammatory conditions. Causes of concomitant low IOP and inflammation include trauma\r\n      and eye surgery, especially glaucoma surgery. Inflammatory causes include scleritis.\r\n\r\n      Modern glaucoma surgery has minimized the incidence of postoperative hypotony and resultant\r\n      choroidal effusion but it is still prevalent. 1 The prevalence of choroidal effusions after\r\n      glaucoma surgery varies between 10 and 15%, with average of 13% after trabeculectomy (the\r\n      standard technique of glaucoma surgery). 5 A complication of low-IOP-induced choroidal\r\n      effusion is hypotony maculopathy, which can cause permanent decline in vision, especially if\r\n      not resolved in a timely manner. 5 Treatment can be either medical or surgical. Medical\r\n      treatment includes cessation of any systemic and topical IOP lowering agents and adding\r\n      cycloplegic agents, topical steroids and eventually systemic steroids. If treatments do not\r\n      increase the IOP and reduce the choroidal effusion, then surgical management should be\r\n      considered.\r\n\r\n      Depending on the particular clinical circumstances of each patient, different surgical\r\n      approaches can be used, including revision of the trabeculectomy flap, anterior chamber\r\n      reformation, and surgical drainage of the effusion.\r\n\r\n      As an alternative to systemic steroids, steroids as triamcinolone acetonide (Kenalog\u2122) can be\r\n      injected in the subtenons space. This treatment allows for a high local dose of steroids,\r\n      without exposing the patient to systemic treatment. Not every patient requires steroid\r\n      injection, and this treatment will be reserved for patients who do not respond to medical\r\n      management after a few days.\r\n\r\n      Following the sham or Kenalog injection participants will receive topical prednisolone\r\n      acetate 1% qid for 4 weeks or PRN Topical atropine 1% qid for one week or PRN.\r\n\r\n      There are several studies in the literature showing the benefit of a triamcinolone injection\r\n      for different inflammatory conditions, such uveitis and for the treatment of diabetic\r\n      maculopaty and cystoid macular edema. 6-9 Recently Shen et al. published the benefit of\r\n      subtenons triamcinolone acetonide in the management of a combination of retinal detachment\r\n      and choroidal effusion. 2 However we did not find any studies that assessed the benefit on\r\n      triamcinolone subtenons injection for choroidal effusion after glaucoma surgery. In a recent\r\n      retrospective study we performed a chart review of the effect of subtenons triamcinolone\r\n      injection in patients with choroidal effusions after glaucoma surgery compared to a group of\r\n      patients who did not receive the injection as part of their management.

Typically, patients who have glaucoma are treated with\r\n      topical medications or incisional surgery to lower the IOP. Micropulse transscleral\r\n      cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) is a non-incisional laser surgery used in the treatment of\r\n      glaucoma. MP-TSCPC powered by the Cyclo G6 (Iridex Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA)\r\n      causes mild thermal damage to the ciliary body (gland that produces aqueous fluid in the\r\n      eye), which, in turn, causes a decrease in intraocular pressure. MP-TSCPC is a variation of a\r\n      longstanding older treatment for glaucoma, traditional diode TSCPC, which caused a\r\n      significant amount of tissue damage and therefore was reserved for the treatment of end stage\r\n      glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      The micropulse laser application includes an on-off cycle. In an on cycle, the micropulse\r\n      probe administers a short pulse of laser energy followed by an off cycle which is a rest\r\n      period for the tissue to cool off before the next on-off cycle begins. This corresponds to\r\n      0.5 ms duration of \"on-time\" and 1.1 ms interval of \"off-time\" during the laser application.\r\n      This on-off cycle allows for the laser to treat the affected area without evidence of tissue\r\n      damage, as opposed to the traditional diode TSCPC. Because only 31.3% of the total laser\r\n      energy is applied to the ciliary body, there is a less tissue damage, less post-operative\r\n      inflammation, and decreased complication rates. Therefore, MP-TSCPC is currently being\r\n      utilized for milder cases of glaucoma, and in patients with viable vision. The laser probe is\r\n      usually applied perpendicular to the limbus in a continuous sweeping motion, for an average\r\n      of 10 seconds of sweeping time per hemifield, referred to as \"dwell time\". Therefore, the\r\n      three parameters that can be varied in the treatment with MP-TSCPC are total laser duration\r\n      (seconds), laser power (mW) and dwell time (seconds/hemifield).\r\n\r\n      Most of the studies used a laser power of 2000 - 2500 mW. The laser duration also has varied\r\n      between studies. A duration time of 50 to 180 sec per hemisphere was used in different\r\n      studies. Most studies have utilized a dwell time of 10 seconds per hemifield, and one cited\r\n      an application of a \"stop and go\" method, applying the laser in discrete spots at 10 seconds\r\n      each.\r\n\r\n      In all of the prior studies, despite the variable applications of power, dwell time, and\r\n      duration, there have been similar rates of complications such as vision loss, macular edema,\r\n      and hypotony. Generally, the laser duration is tailor-made and is adjusted based on the iris\r\n      color and severity of glaucoma. However, there is a gap in knowledge on systematic comparison\r\n      of different doses of MP-TSCPC for a safe and effective treatment of glaucoma.

According to the most recent data , this disease is\r\n      the second cause of blindness in the world (12.3%). An estimate indicates that, by 2020,\r\n      there will be 79.6 million glaucomatous individuals in the world. The estimated prevalence of\r\n      primary glaucoma in the Brazilian population was 3.4%, consisting of 2.4% open angle and 0.7%\r\n      closed angle.\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma can be: open angle, angle-closure, congenital or secondary. Increased IOP is the\r\n      major risk factor for glaucoma progression as well as its fluctuation (difference between the\r\n      highest and lowest IOP measure) in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). In addition, age,\r\n      family history, central corneal thickness, race, high myopia, hypermetropia, diabetes\r\n      mellitus, hypertension and hypotension, gender, optic disc hemorrhages, suspected optic nerve\r\n      excavation, and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.\r\n\r\n      The treatment depends on the classification of glaucoma, since in the POAG, the initial\r\n      treatment is with topical monotherapy (ocular hypotensors). However, in some situations, drug\r\n      treatment is not enough to stabilize the process of glaucomatous progression. In these cases,\r\n      incisional surgery or laser treatment is necessary.\r\n\r\n      Trabeculectomy consists of an intervention to increase drainage of the aqueous humor, in\r\n      order to control the IOP and prevent the progression of the disease. However, due to its\r\n      complications, such as atalamia, hypotonia, the development of cataract and the risk of\r\n      endophthalmitis, this procedure is indicated in the refractory cases to clinical and/or laser\r\n      treatment. Thus, clinical treatment and trabeculoplasty are the treatments of choice.\r\n      Trabeculoplasty is indicated in the cases of POAG, pseudoexfoliative, pigmented and in some\r\n      cases of secondary and trabecular glaucoma visible to the gonioscopy.\r\n\r\n      The tonometer is the device used to detect IOP increase. Despite the existence of several\r\n      models, Goldmann's applanation is considered the gold standard for this measurement, since it\r\n      evaluates the force necessary to deform the surface of the cornea. This method is quite\r\n      accurate, however, errors may occur in the result due to fluorescein patterns, very thick\r\n      corneas, excessive pressure on the eyeball when holding the patient's eyelids or elevated\r\n      corneal astigmatism without the adequate compensatory positioning of the planer.\r\n\r\n      The measurement of IOP can also be performed through another type of tonometer: non-contact,\r\n      pneumatic or blow. It was first used in 1973 by Forbes and its advantages are: 1) no need for\r\n      the use of eye drops, 2) it can be performed by people who are not doctors, 3) it has a low\r\n      risk of contamination and 4) it can be used for screening programs. However, a study by Britt\r\n      et al. showed the presence of lachrymal film dehiscence and the existence of microaerosol\r\n      with the air blow, which would make this method not so aseptic.\r\n\r\n      According to the study, where the pneumatic tonometer was compared with that of Goldmann, the\r\n      results obtained were: 50% of the evaluated eyes showed no differences between the two\r\n      devices and in 85% they were between approximately 2 mmHg. In another study which compared\r\n      the IOP values measured by the mentioned tonometers, it was verified that the pneumatic\r\n      tonometer underestimates the IOP values, compared to Goldmann, in thin corneas; however,\r\n      there is no significant difference between the measurements of the two tonometers in thick\r\n      corneas.\r\n\r\n      The Water Drinking Test (WDT) is a propaedeutic widely used to evaluate the maximum\r\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) and its fluctuation. These data are extremely important for the\r\n      expected result in relation to the reproducibility of the exams, since in the study , showed\r\n      that the WDT can be used to estimate the peak and diurnal fluctuation of supine IOP in the\r\n      simplified daily stress curve (another method for the same purpose of the WDT) in patients\r\n      under treatment for glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma is a serious eye health problem, as it has a high incidence and prevalence worldwide\r\n      and is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. Therefore, it is extremely\r\n      important to perform tests that will detect altered IOP values.\r\n\r\n      The IOP values obtained over a 24 hour period are important data, since they are required to\r\n      control and conduct the treatment of glaucoma. In the past, the WDT has often been used to\r\n      diagnose patients with this pathology. Due to a series of studies,it was found that the WDT\r\n      can not be used as a diagnostic test, but as a tool to evaluate changes in IOP peaks. In\r\n      addition, a comparison of reproducibility between devices will facilitate a better\r\n      evaluation, speed, safety and efficacy in the treatment, contributing to increase the quality\r\n      of life of the patient and also to guide other studies in this area.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT02681419", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucoma"], "exclusion": [], "brief_title": "Evaluating the Efficacy of Fenestrations in Tube Shunt Implants During the Early Postoperative Period", "brief_summary": "\n      This study evaluates two different methods of controlling intraocular pressure in nonvalved\r\n      aqueous tube shunts immediately after implantation; needle fenestrations or a suture wick.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      This is a prospective, randomized control study of glaucomatous eye undergoing tube shunt\r\n      implantation using a nonvalved implant for poorly controlled glaucoma of any type.

Several recent studies have characterized significant visual function\r\n      deficits in glaucoma patients that may be more sensitive indicators of disease than classical\r\n      visual field loss, including compromised contrast sensitivity (CS), increased disability\r\n      glare (DG) and protracted dark adaptation (DA).\r\n\r\n      Given the available evidence, it appears that visual function, if assessed carefully, is a\r\n      reliable indicator of ocular health and/or disease state. It follows that an improvement in\r\n      visual function would be indicative of an improvement in ocular health. Although improvement\r\n      of visual function is not typically seen in ocular disease, there is recent evidence to\r\n      suggest that visual performance and associated progression of ocular disease may actually be\r\n      modifiable via nutritional strategies and dietary modification in age-related macular\r\n      degeneration (AMD). Because some of the compromised visual performance experienced in\r\n      glaucoma is associated with increased ocular inflammation, local anti-inflammatory action may\r\n      improve visual performance in glaucoma patients. Given their exceptional anti-inflammatory\r\n      activity and potential for rich deposition in the retina, the macular carotenoids lutein (L),\r\n      zeaxanthin (Z), and mesozeaxanthin (MZ) may hold promise for this strategy. Indeed, a recent\r\n      cross-sectional study of the relationship between macular carotenoid level and visual\r\n      performance in glaucoma patients found that those patients with low levels were significantly\r\n      more likely to experience problems with glare - and were also more likely to have greater\r\n      ganglion cell loss.\r\n\r\n      L and Z are diet-derived, yellow-orange colored carotenoids obtained primarily from\r\n      leafy-green vegetables. L and Z are not synthesized by the body, and therefore must be\r\n      obtained via dietary means; those who have diets rich in leafy greens, or supplement with\r\n      sufficient L and Z tend to maintain and accumulate higher blood and tissue concentrations.\r\n      One of the conspicuous features of L and Z is their specific accumulation in the macular\r\n      retina, where they can reach extremely high concentrations - values as high as 1.50 log\r\n      optical density near the foveal center are not uncommon; it is also not uncommon to see\r\n      concentrations in the fovea that exceed 10,000 times that seen in the blood. Once deposited\r\n      in the retina, some of the L is converted to a stereoisomeric form of zeaxanthin, called\r\n      mesozeaxanthin (MZ). Although rare, MZ has been shown to exist in nature, and indeed in the\r\n      human food chain - its presence has been recently verified in salmon, trout, and sardine\r\n      skin, and also trout flesh. Importantly, MZ has been shown to be readily deposited in the\r\n      retina when taken in supplement form. The accumulation of these three carotenoids in the\r\n      macula yields a yellowish-orange coloration, classically known to ophthalmologists as the\r\n      \"macula lutea\" (\"yellow spot\"). Today, this collective pigmentation is commonly referred to\r\n      as macular pigment (MP), with concentrations typically expressed in terms of optical density\r\n      (MPOD). Xanthophyll carotenoids such as L, Z, and MZ are especially potent antioxidants. Via\r\n      a process called triplet excitation transfer, L, Z, and MZ can regenerate to repeatedly\r\n      \"quench\" the energy of singlet oxygen. This makes them capable of long-term accumulation in\r\n      target tissues such as the retina, where, in the absence of excessive oxidative or\r\n      inflammatory stress (e.g. smoking, or systemic disease such as diabetes), they are resistant\r\n      to turnover, and can provide continuous protection against oxidation and inflammation.\r\n\r\n      Another critical function of the macular carotenoids involves their optical properties within\r\n      the eye. Visual discomfort in glare, disability glare, and photostress recovery time are all\r\n      significantly improved with higher MPOD status. CS has also been found in several\r\n      laboratories (for both normal and clinical populations) to be related to / enhanced by\r\n      augmentation of MPOD. Dark adaptation speed, absolute scotopic thresholds, and mesopic\r\n      contrast sensitivity have also been found to be impacted positively by MPOD.\r\n\r\n      A high concentration of macular carotenoids (i.e. high MPOD) is therefore advantageous in at\r\n      least three ways: 1) Protection from oxidation and inflammation, 2) Filtration of potentially\r\n      actinic high-energy short-wavelength light, and 3) Improvement of visual performance (via\r\n      pre-receptoral screening of short-wave light and neurophysiological enhancement).\r\n\r\n      For baseline measures, the proposed study has the potential to determine cross-sectional\r\n      relationships between MPOD, visual performance, and disease severity in glaucoma. Given the\r\n      recent data, significant relationships are plausible - and if the investigators determine\r\n      these kinds of relationships, standard of care for glaucoma patients could be changed to\r\n      include improved patient education regarding nutrition. Additionally, visual function testing\r\n      (to include CS, DA, and DG testing) may be instituted for glaucoma suspects and established\r\n      glaucoma patients. If the investigators are able to show an acute effect of improvement in\r\n      visual performance, it could lead to larger trials that may yield extremely important data\r\n      with regard to management of glaucoma. Given the predicted exponential increase in worldwide\r\n      glaucoma prevalence (76 million in 2020 to 111.8 million in 2040), strategies that may\r\n      promote good visual function in glaucoma would be hugely significant.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00626782", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": [], "exclusion": ["infection", "inflammation"], "brief_title": "Lucentis Versus Mitomycin C During Glaucoma Surgery", "brief_summary": "\n      Does a new add on (or adjunctive) therapy used in glaucoma surgery improve the success of\r\n      trabeculectomy?

The macula comprises about 30% of all retinal ganglion cells and its\r\n      information corresponds to over 50% of the visual cortex. However, glaucomatous damage to the\r\n      macula is often missed in clinical practice. Some of the reasons are:\r\n\r\n        1. traditional glaucoma knowledge supports that glaucoma is fundamentally a peripheral\r\n           disease;\r\n\r\n        2. inherent limitations of conventional clinical tests to detect damage to the macula; and\r\n\r\n        3. the paucity of large, prospective studies that describe the nature of glaucomatous\r\n           damage to the macula.\r\n\r\n      The investigators have published numerous papers in the past two years showing that macular\r\n      damage is prevalent among patients with early glaucoma if one employs the appropriate tools\r\n      to assess it, namely 10-2 visual fields and high-resolution optical coherence tomography\r\n      (OCT). This information comes from a unique prospective cross- sectional database and\r\n      techniques the investigators developed to produce objective metrics of structure and\r\n      function.\r\n\r\n      Now that the investigators understand the cross-sectional nature of macular damage, this\r\n      proposal aims to:\r\n\r\n        1. develop a longitudinal database including patients with early glaucoma and healthy\r\n           controls,\r\n\r\n        2. to test models that explain progression of macular damage, and\r\n\r\n        3. to apply new statistical methods combining structural and functional tests which could\r\n           improve the accuracy to detect progression and shorten the length of clinical trials.\r\n\r\n      The main hypothesis is that incorporating 10-2 visual field testing and high-resolution OCT\r\n      scans of the macula to the conventional repertoire of technologies used in clinical practice,\r\n      in addition to translating recently described statistical methods into softwares that can be\r\n      used in daily practice, enhances the performance and confidence to detect glaucoma\r\n      progression.\r\n\r\n      In Aim 1 the investigators plan to follow healthy subjects and glaucoma patients at regular\r\n      intervals with 10-2, 24-2 visual fields, and swept source (ss) OCT tests and define metrics\r\n      of short- and long-term test variability that are needed to differentiate true progression\r\n      from 'noise'. To date, there is no such database combining these technologies.\r\n\r\n      In Aim 2 the investigators plan to combine metrics of structure and function from this\r\n      longitudinal database using two methods: a spatial approach, which will ultimately produce a\r\n      joint structure-function index using 10-2 and ssOCT data; and a temporal approach, which will\r\n      employ Bayesian statistics to measure rates of progression using trend analysis.

Low Vision Rehabilitation (LVR) is part of the continuum of\r\n           eye care that extends from diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, designed to help\r\n           visually impaired patients retain vision to the maximum, make activities easier to\r\n           perform, regain independence, and improve their QOL.

In this study, we aim to\r\n      establish the clinical significance of keeping a time interval between glaucoma medications.\r\n\r\n      The study composes of two separate parts:\r\n\r\n      Part 1 - The aim of this part will be to estimate the short term effect on IOP reduction.\r\n      Healthy subjects willing to participate voluntarily, will be given two IOP reduction drugs\r\n      (Tilopitc and Alphagan) at different intervals in each eye. After which they will undergo\r\n      repeated IOP measurements over a course of 7 hours.\r\n\r\n      Part 2 - The aim of this part will be to estimate the short term effect on IOP reduction.\r\n      Glaucoma patients treated in the glaucoma clinic at Sheba-Medical center who are taking two\r\n      different types of IOP reduction drugs in both eyes, will be recruited. The patients will be\r\n      asked to keep a constant 5 minute interval between drops in one eye and to instill the drops\r\n      in the other eye with no waiting time. After one month the patients will return for a\r\n      revaluation of IOP and then be asked to switch the eyes so that the eye in which the interval\r\n      was not kept will now be the one in which the drop will be put after 5 minute interval.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00168363", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["ocular_hypertension", "glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["allergy"], "brief_title": "Safety and Efficacy of Brimonidine in Patients With Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension", "brief_summary": "\n      This Study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of brimonidine in patients with glaucoma or\r\n      ocular hypertension\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT01517477", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open-angle_glaucoma", "poag", "hypotensive"], "exclusion": ["traumatic,_veitic"], "brief_title": "One, Two, or Three iStents for the Reduction of Intraocular Pressure in Open-angle Glaucoma Subjects", "brief_summary": "\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the intraocular pressure\r\n      (IOP) lowering effect of one, two, or three iStent devices in eyes of subjects previously on\r\n      two anti-glaucoma medications.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT02084745", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["loss_of_corneal_clarity"], "exclusion": ["terminal_glaucoma", "terminal_retinal_diseases"], "brief_title": "Timing of Glaucoma Drainage Device With Boston Keratoprosthesis", "brief_summary": "\n      Boston keratoprosthesis (KPro) is a piece of specialized plastic that replace sick cornea\r\n      (transparent structure at the front of the eye) in patients who have failed or those who are\r\n      expected to have poor results with traditional corneal transplantation. While the Kpro can\r\n      offer dramatic improvement in vision, it is also associated with several complications.\r\n      Glaucoma (optic nerve damage due to high pressure inside the eye) is one of the most common\r\n      complications after KPro surgery and can potentially cause irreversible vision loss. The\r\n      implantation of a glaucoma drainage device (GDD), a tiny tube that drains the liquid inside\r\n      the eye by bypassing the natural drainage system, is an effective option to lower the eye\r\n      pressure in patients with KPro. Given the frequency and potentially devastating effects of\r\n      glaucoma among KPro patients, some surgeons recommend to put in a GDD as a preventative\r\n      measure.

Indeed, many diagnostic indications for KPro\r\n      such as aniridia, chemical burns, trauma and repeated graft failure imply alteration of the\r\n      iridocorneal angle, and consequently high intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucoma.\r\n      Accordingly, the prevalence of glaucoma before KPro surgery lies between 27% and 77%, with\r\n      most studies showing a prevalence above 50%. The diagnosis and management of glaucoma is\r\n      particularly challenging in the KPro population. Preoperatively, the measurement of IOP is\r\n      possible through Goldmann tonometry and pneumotonometry but this measurement may be erroneous\r\n      due to corneal scarring and irregularity. Furthermore, corneal opacification usually prevents\r\n      visualization of the optic nerve head, and visual field assessment is not possible due to\r\n      poor vision. Therefore, while glaucoma is often suspected in patients undergoing KPro, this\r\n      diagnosis may be only confirmed postoperatively. While optic nerve head and visual field\r\n      examination become possible following KPro surgery, the determination of IOP can only be\r\n      accomplished through digital palpation. The shortcomings of this method, including its very\r\n      poor inter- and intra-observer reliability, are well recognized. Because IOP reduction is the\r\n      basis of glaucoma treatment, it is exceedingly difficult to manage glaucoma in the KPro\r\n      population. In the face of such complexity, some KPro surgeons have suggested that Glaucoma\r\n      Drainage Device (GDD) implantation could be performed during KPro surgery in all patients\r\n      with marginal preoperative IOP control. With this approach, the GDD could prevent\r\n      postoperative IOP rise and the need for subsequent surgical and medical intervention.\r\n\r\n      RATIONALE:\r\n\r\n      The decision to implant a GDD in a patient with pre-existing or prospective KPro must be\r\n      weighed carefully. The insidious development or progression of glaucoma is the most common\r\n      blinding complication of KPro implantation. Indeed, the course of glaucoma is a major\r\n      determinant of KPro surgery prognosis and specifically of the visual result. On the other\r\n      hand, complications associated with concomitant GDD and KPro surgeries may in themselves lead\r\n      to severe and irreversible vision loss and thus, prevent the visual rehabilitation of these\r\n      patients. With the increasing use of the KPro, it is important to evaluate the optimal timing\r\n      of GDD implantation.\r\n\r\n      HYPOTHESIS:\r\n\r\n      For patients undergoing the Boston KPro surgery, implanting a GDD simultaneously, at the time\r\n      of surgery, is more efficacious than waiting 6 months to implant a GDD, in the prevention of\r\n      the progression of glaucoma and in maintaining better visual acuity and visual fields\r\n\r\n      OBJECTIVE:\r\n\r\n        1. To determine the most appropriate time to implant a GDD in order to prevent the\r\n           deleterious effect of glaucomatous optic neuropathy on visual rehabilitation of patients\r\n           implanted with the Boston KPro.\r\n\r\n        2. To compare the outcomes of the visual acuity, visual field and glaucomatous optic disc\r\n           damage by implanting a GDD at the time of KPro surgery versus implanting GDD 6 months\r\n           post-KPro surgery.\r\n\r\n      METHODS:\r\n\r\n      Design: Single blind, prospective randomized controlled trial\r\n\r\n      Study Population: The duration of the study is 5 years, 4 years to recruit and 1 year to\r\n      follow each patient. Forty consecutive patients (forty eyes) will be enrolled in this study.\r\n      One eye of each patient will be included. The study protocol is approved by the Ethics\r\n      Committee of CHUM. All patients will be informed about the design of the study and the\r\n      procedure, and written informed consent will be obtained from all patients. Patient's\r\n      eligibility for the study will be evaluated at the first consultation visit.\r\n\r\n      At the baseline study visit, patients will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation into two\r\n      groups. Group 1 will comprise 20 patients undergoing KPro and simultaneous GDD while group 2\r\n      will include 20 patients undergoing KPro and then GDD 6 months later. Randomization schedule\r\n      will be computer generated.\r\n\r\n      Prior to the surgery, a complete medical and ophthalmological history will be obtained from\r\n      each patient. Patients will undergo a thorough ophthalmological evaluation, A-scan and B-scan\r\n      ultrasound. The primary and concomitant pre-operative diagnoses are noted. The Boston KPro,\r\n      purchased from Massachusetts Eye and Ear infirmary (Boston, MA), is implanted using the usual\r\n      standard technique. The GDD that will be used is the Ahmed implant (New World Medical, Rancho\r\n      Cucamonga, CA). The Ahmed implant will be implanted using the standard technique either at\r\n      the time of KPro surgery in group 1, or 6 months following KPro in group 2. Standard\r\n      postoperative management will be followed. Follow-up visits will be performed on day 1, week\r\n      1, and months 1, 3, 6, and 12.\r\n\r\n      Study Procedures\r\n\r\n        1. Visual acuity will be measured pre-operatively and at each visit.\r\n\r\n        2. Humphrey Visual Field 24-2 (SITA-Fast) will be performed at post-op 1 month, 3 months, 6\r\n           months, and 1 year. In cases where an automated visual field test is unreliable due to\r\n           unacceptable number of false positives (>33%), false negatives (>33%), or fixation\r\n           losses (>20%), a Goldmann Visual Field will be performed.\r\n\r\n        3. Optic disc examination will be done by a glaucoma specialist on post-operative days 1\r\n           and post-operative months 1, 3, 6, and 12 and graded according to the Disc Damage\r\n           Likelihood Scale (DDLS). The chart containing measures of DDLS made on previous visits\r\n           will not be made available to the clinician.\r\n\r\n        4. Stereoscopic photographs of the optic disc will be taken on postoperative months 1, 3,\r\n           6, 12. The blinded glaucoma specialist will assign a DDLS to each photograph.\r\n\r\n      Each patient's test results will be compiled in a table. Based on data available one month\r\n      post-operatively, the investigators will decide whether there is evidence of glaucomatous\r\n      optic neuropathy at this time (thereby likely reflecting presence of pre-existing glaucoma).\r\n      Based on data gathered over 12 months, the investigators will decide whether or not the\r\n      glaucoma has progressed through the course of the study.\r\n\r\n      All medical records, including operative protocol and progress notes, will be analyzed and\r\n      data will be collected with respect to ophthalmic diagnosis of the operated eye. Patient\r\n      demographics (age and gender), preoperative diagnosis, presence of pre-KPro glaucoma,\r\n      surgical feasibility, retention of both GDD and KPro devices, short and long term\r\n      complications of eyes who receive GDD will be studied. Patients who experience vision loss\r\n      secondary to GDD complications such as tube occlusion, overfiltration, hypotony and choroidal\r\n      hemorrhage will be analyzed in greater detail. Complications related to post-operative\r\n      glaucoma will be evaluated. The extent of visual recuperation and the impact of glaucomatous\r\n      optic nerve damage on the visual potential will be studied. Continued progression of glaucoma\r\n      and the need for medical and surgical therapy will be determined.\r\n\r\n      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:\r\n\r\n      The primary outcomes of this study, Visual Fields (Sita 24-2) and glaucomatous disc damage\r\n      will be compared between both groups. Log rank test will be used to check the significance of\r\n      differences between both groups. Pre- and post-best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), as\r\n      expressed in logMar units, will be compared in each group and plotted to demonstrate the\r\n      evolution over time of the visual acuity in each group. Percentages of patients with fixation\r\n      loss (BCVA worse than 1.30 logMar) at final visits from the two groups will also be compared.\r\n\r\n      The suitable time of GDD implantation will be determined by analyzing the visual outcome at\r\n      the start and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-KPro and calculating the hazard on each time point.\r\n      For this, time varying survival models - Cox and accelerated failure time (AFT) models will\r\n      be applied according to their validity. The risk in both groups can be shown graphically by\r\n      Kaplan Meier survival curve for loss of visual field and glaucomatous optic disc damage.\r\n      Tests for statistical significance will be carried out at alpha=0.05.\r\n\r\n      SIGNIFICANCE:\r\n\r\n      The Boston KPro allows recovery of sight to patients with reversible corneal blindness.\r\n      Glaucoma, a serious and sight threatening complication of KPro, may rob patients irreversibly\r\n      and permanently of the sight they had recovered. The results of study will shed light on the\r\n      most appropriate timing of glaucoma prevention and treatment. Hence, glaucoma will be treated\r\n      in a timely fashion, preventing irreversible visual loss without subjecting patients to undue\r\n      complications of glaucoma surgery.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT01417689", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["allergy", "fluorescein"], "brief_title": "Eyedrop Instillation Technique", "brief_summary": "\n      Eye drop instillation is a problem from glaucoma patients.

Our hypothesis was\r\n      that adherence would be improved in the intervention group and that patients would better\r\n      understand their disease and how to manage it.\r\n\r\n      METHODS Study Design and Population: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in\r\n      newly diagnosed glaucoma patients at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, Canada. Half\r\n      of the participants were randomized to receive the intervention and half were randomized to\r\n      receive a delayed intervention at the conclusion of the study. Inclusion criteria included a\r\n      diagnosis of glaucoma requiring intraocular pressure lowering eye drop therapy and\r\n      prescription drug insurance through the R\u00e9gie de l'Assurance Maladie du Qu\u00e9bec (RAMQ) (the\r\n      Quebec Health Insurance Program) throughout the course of the study. There were three sources\r\n      of data for this study: a questionnaire, the medical record, and RAMQ prescription drug\r\n      claims data. Follow-up was for one year.\r\n\r\n      Recruitment and Randomization: From July, 2007 until December, 2011, a researcher approached\r\n      eligible patients to determine their interest in participating in the study. Interested\r\n      participants signed the informed consent form and were randomized. Participants in the\r\n      intervention group were given an appointment to come back to the Hospital for the group\r\n      intervention. Participants in the control group were given an appointment to receive the\r\n      group intervention at the end of the study.\r\n\r\n      Intervention: Small groups of about 10 people were gathered for two 60-90 minute educational\r\n      sessions on glaucoma in a classroom at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. During a break, each\r\n      patient received one-on-one teaching on how to properly instill drops without touching the\r\n      eye or using unnecessary drops.\r\n\r\n      Questionnaire and Assessment of Eye Drop Technique: A single questionnaire was given at the\r\n      end of the study to all participants. The intervention group completed the questionnaire\r\n      after the intervention while the control group completed the questionnaire before the\r\n      intervention. Questions were included on demographics, systemic comorbidities, ocular\r\n      medications, eye drop practices and difficulties, and glaucoma knowledge.\r\n\r\n      The instructor rated the ability of the participant to put eye drops in the eye taking into\r\n      account the number of drops that were used and whether contact with the lid or conjunctiva\r\n      occurred (good, fair, bad).\r\n\r\n      We created a composite score on the perception of the importance of glaucoma eye drop therapy\r\n      using the following four questions: 1) do you think glaucoma is a serious disease, 2) do you\r\n      believe that your treatment will be effective, 3) do you think your drops can lower the\r\n      pressure in your eyes, 4) do you think your drops can help to preserve vision. Answers of no\r\n      or do not know were given 0 points and answers of yes were given 1 point. Scores were summed\r\n      and the composite score ranged from 0 to 4.\r\n\r\n      Medical Chart Review: At the end of the follow-up period, information was obtained on: the\r\n      prescribed eye drop therapy for each patient per eye, whether the patient had undergone\r\n      glaucoma filtering surgery, whether the patient had died or was no longer being followed, the\r\n      most recent visual field mean deviation in the better eye using the Humphrey Visual Field\r\n      Analyzer 24-2 SITA Standard Program.\r\n\r\n      Pharmaceutical Claims and Calculation of Medication Possession Ratio: The Medication\r\n      Possession Ratio (MPR) was calculated as the sum of days of prescription supply divided by\r\n      the number of days in which a prescription was required. Each person gave consent to contact\r\n      the RAMQ to obtain pharmaceutical claims for all glaucoma medications. Data were collected on\r\n      the date of purchase, and the name, dose, and class of the medicine. Data on the number of\r\n      days of medication available per bottle were taken from the Rylander and Friedman studies\r\n      with the minimum value used. For the numerator of the MPR, we calculated how many days of\r\n      medication were available using RAMQ data. For the denominator of the MPR, we calculated the\r\n      number of days that medication was prescribed in the medical chart. We took into account\r\n      whether drops were needed for one or two eyes. If a participant was on multiple medications,\r\n      we calculated a single mean MPR for all medications. We then dichotomized the MPR so that\r\n      those having medication less than 75% of the days were defined as non-adherent, as we did\r\n      previously in Djafari et al.\r\n\r\n      SIGNIFICANCE Adherence can be a problem in glaucoma because patients must often take daily\r\n      eye drops despite not noticing any benefit to their vision and despite frequent side effects.\r\n      Low cost interventions that help to improve adherence are needed.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT02053298", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": [], "exclusion": ["ocular_diseases", "ocular_trauma", "cataract", "eye_disease", "systemic_diseases", "diabetes"], "brief_title": "Impact of Timolol/Dorzolamide Therapy on Autoregulation in Glaucoma Patients", "brief_summary": "\n      Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy in which the main risk factor is intraocular pressure (IOP).\r\n      The search for other variables involved in glaucoma pathogenesis and progression has\r\n      identified both systemic and ocular signs of vascular dysfunction in glaucoma patients, such\r\n      as migraine, peripheral vasospasm, systemic hypotension and cerebral microvascular ischemia.\r\n      Ocular blood flow studies using Color Doppler Imaging (CDI) technology has demonstrated blood\r\n      velocities and increased vascular resistance (RI) to exist in such patients when compared to\r\n      healthy controls. However, a CDI examination provides far more additional information, such\r\n      as arterial pulsatility (PI) and mean blood velocities (MFV). While these have been used for\r\n      decades now to study cerebral arteries vasoreactivity, little is known about how these\r\n      variables are changed in glaucoma patients. We have recently demonstrated that these\r\n      variables can be used to identify a change in the normal vascular activity when there is\r\n      increased resistance. In glaucoma patients, a cutpoint in RI of the retrobulbar arteries\r\n      could be determined beyond which PI increased significantly. This sharp increase in the PI\r\n      has been used as an indirect signal that the vessel's ability to buffer a decreased perfusion\r\n      pressure has been surpassed. The normal response to a decreased perfusion in a vascular\r\n      territory with autoregulation is an increase in dilation in the downstream microcirculation,\r\n      increasing cross section area in an attempt to keep a steady MFV. As PI is calculated using\r\n      the vessel's MFV [PI = (PSV-EDV)/MFV], it is highly sensitive to changes in this variable. As\r\n      such, the cutpoints we have identified in glaucoma patients are therefore an indirect\r\n      assessment of the vessel's autoregulation limit.\r\n\r\n      While our data could provide the rational as to why these RI values are associated with\r\n      progression, the clinical question arises as to whether these cutpoints can be modulated by\r\n      topical glaucoma therapy. As some medications such as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have been\r\n      found to have a positive effect in disease progression in what appears to be a non-IOP\r\n      related effect, we considered the hypothesis that these drugs could have a positive impact on\r\n      the ocular's microcirculation vasoactive response, potentially enabling to keep a steady MFV\r\n      into higher values of vascular resistance.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Patients will be recruited from the glaucoma clinic at the department of Ophthalmology in the\r\n      Leuven University Hospital.\r\n\r\n      General study setup:\r\n\r\n      Two cohorts of subjects will be included in the study: primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and\r\n      normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients.

Using a randomized clinical\r\n      trial with cross-over design, the purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of RLRL\r\n      therapy on existing visual field damages in POAG patients.\r\n\r\n      This study is a 24-week, prospective, randomized, cross-over clinical trial, enrolling POAG\r\n      patients with well-controlled IOP as participants.

Primary\r\n      open angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type of glaucoma accounting for 74% of all\r\n      glaucoma cases (1, 2). Trabeculectomy is still the most commonly performed glaucoma surgery\r\n      worldwide (3). However, trabeculectomy has several vision-threatening complications as ocular\r\n      hypotony, choroidal detachment and bleb related infections (4). Therefore, in the recent\r\n      years, bleb independent less invasive procedures as canaloplasty (5,6), gonioscopy-assisted\r\n      transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) (7,8) and ab externo circumferential trabeculotomy (6,9)\r\n      have become increasingly popular because of their great efficacy and excellent safety\r\n      profile. Despite the successful outcomes and the few postoperative complications of GATT in\r\n      juvenile and adult POAG, however on the downside, surgeons with less experience performing\r\n      GATT procedure may initially struggle with it. Also, GATT requires a goniolens and a\r\n      reasonably clear cornea to visualize the nasal angle. Introducing instruments into the\r\n      anterior chamber also poses an increased risk for damage to intraocular structures (10, 11).\r\n      Looking at ab externo trabeculotomy, for many years, many authors have demonstrated its\r\n      efficacy in lowering IOP in congenital (12, 13, 14), juvenile (15, 16) and adult open angle\r\n      glaucomas (6, 9, 17). Trabeculotomy ab externo techniques include conventional probe\r\n      trabeculotomy, viscotrabeculotomy (VT) (17), 360 - degree suture trabeculotomy (9) ,\r\n      viscocircumferential -suture trabeculotomy (VCST) (14) and trabeculotomy with the use of\r\n      illuminated microcatheter.(15,18). Although the illuminated microcatheter helps to cannulate\r\n      SC safely, however its cost constitutes a financial burden in many countries. VCST was proved\r\n      to be effective for reduction of IOP in PCG as it offers the advantages of performing 360\r\n      circumferential trabeculotomy with a great ease and a low cost (14). The aim of the present\r\n      study was to compare the surgical outcomes of (VCST) and rigid probe VT in patients with\r\n      POAG.\r\n\r\n      Purpose:\r\n\r\n      This study aims to compare the surgical outcomes of (VCST) and rigid probe VT in patients\r\n      with POAG.\r\n\r\n      Methods:\r\n\r\n      The study is conducted at Mansoura university ophthalmic Center. Sample size has been\r\n      calculated using Cochran's formula with a 95% confidence level and Z value of 1.95. This\r\n      comparative study was conducted on 166 eyes of 107 patients with medically uncontrolled\r\n      primary open-angle glaucoma diagnosed and operated upon in the Mansoura Ophthalmic Center of\r\n      Mansoura University, Egypt between February 2017 and December 2020. The study follows the\r\n      tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients of the study received a clear explanation\r\n      of the study design, the surgical procedures and their possible consequences and they gave\r\n      written informed consent.\r\n\r\n      Preoperative Evaluation All of the patients underwent a full ophthalmological examination,\r\n      particularly estimation of the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) (the decimal notation was\r\n      converted to LogMAR), slit lamp examination, IOP measurement by Goldmann's applanation\r\n      tonometry, gonioscopy using Goldmann 3-mirrors goniolens for angle grading using Schaffer's\r\n      grading system and fundus examination. Visual field (VF) assessment was performed by SITA\r\n      strategy perimetry (Humphrey, central 24-2 standard strategy). Retinal nerve fiber layer\r\n      (RNFL) thickness and optic disc were evaluated using a spectral domain optical coherence\r\n      tomography (OCT; Topcon, Japan). The number of antiglaucoma medications was recorded.\r\n\r\n      Eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, with a gonioscopically open angle, an IOP above 21 mm\r\n      Hg despite the maximally tolerated antiglaucoma medications, glaucomatous visual field\r\n      defects, and glaucomatous optic disc appearance, in the absence of any obvious cause for\r\n      glaucoma, were included in the study.\r\n\r\n      Patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma, secondary glaucomas, and who were on\r\n      anticoagulant therapy and cannot stop treatment or with media opacity that interfere with\r\n      visual field testing or OCT imaging were excluded from the study.\r\n\r\n      In patients suffering bilateral POAG (59 patients), randomization to either VCST or VT was\r\n      applied to the first operated eye while the other eye was automatically assigned to the other\r\n      procedure and included in the study. All surgical procedures were performed by the same\r\n      experienced surgeon (A.S.E.).\r\n\r\n      Surgical Technique:\r\n\r\n      Surgical techniques of both Visco-Circumferential-Suture-Trabeculotomy (VCST) and rigid probe\r\n      Viscotrabeculotomy (VT) were described previously in details.(14, 17) In\r\n      Visco-Circumferential-Suture-Trabeculotomy (VCST), exposure of the operative field through a\r\n      corneal traction suture (vicryl 6/0) placed superiorly was followed by a superior\r\n      limbal-based conjunctival flap and a paracentesis. After adequate hemostasis, a superficial\r\n      rectangular scleral flap 4\u00d74 mm was fashioned and dissected forward toward the limbus. A deep\r\n      sceral flap (2\u00d72 mm) was then created toward the limbus underneath the superficial flap\r\n      exposing the scleral spur and deroofing SC. Viscoelastic (Healon GV, Pfizer, NY) was\r\n      gradually injected (using a standard 30 G viscocanalostomy cannula) into the ostia of SC\r\n      (dilate SC and facilitate suture progression into the canal). Then, the 5/0 polypropylene\r\n      suture tip was cauterized into a blunt tip (to ensure atraumatic probing of SC). The tip was\r\n      inserted into the left ostium of SC using a microsurgical forceps and advanced through the\r\n      whole circumference of the canal. When the tip presented to the right ostium the AC was\r\n      filled with a viscoelastic through the paracentesis and traction was applied to approximate\r\n      both ends of the 5/0 polypropylene suture, thus creating a visco-360-degree trabeculotomy.\r\n\r\n      For the viscotrabeculotomy group, the surgical procedure involved a fornixbased conjunctival\r\n      incision followed by creation of a partial thickness (about 50% thickness) triangular (4\u00d74\u00d74\r\n      mm) scleral fap, followed by localization of Schlemm's canal by radial incisions straddling\r\n      the limbus. High viscosity sodium hyaluronate (Healon GV, Pfzer) was then slowly injected\r\n      into both ends of Schlemm's canal. Trabeculotomy was completed using the standard Harm's\r\n      trabeculotome (Geuder Instruments), the scleral fap was then secured tightly with interrupted\r\n      10/0 Nylon sutures and conjunctival closure ensued. For the trabeculectomy group the\r\n      fornix-based conjunctival incision was followed by mitomycin C application in a concentration\r\n      of 0.3 mg/mL for 3 min through soaked surgical sponge inserted underneath the conjunctival\r\n      fap and over the sclera posterior to the limbus then thoroughly irrigated by 200 mL of\r\n      sterile normal saline. This was followed by dissection of the scleral fap which was\r\n      rectangular (4\u00d73 mm), followed by trabeculectomy, peripheral iridectomy and then secure\r\n      closure by 10/0 nylon sutures. Filtration was judged arbitrarily according to the surgeon's\r\n      experience and the conjunctiva was then closed securely .\r\n\r\n      For both groups postoperative treatment consisted of topical steroids (dexamethasone) and\r\n      antibiotic (ofoxacin) five times daily with gradual taper over a 5 week period.\r\n\r\n      Cycloplegia (cyclopentolate) was used 3 times daily for the first postoperative week and then\r\n      discontinued. Patients were examined on the first postoperative day and then postoperative\r\n      follow up visits were scheduled at weeks 1 and 2 then months 1, 2 and 3 and then 3 monthly\r\n      till the end of the 24th month (months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24). Complications were noted\r\n      and managed accordingly. The primary outcome measure was the IOP. Secondary outcome measures\r\n      included the BCVA and number of IOP lowering medications. Success was defned as [15] an IOP \u2264\r\n      18 mmHg (criteria 1), an IOP \u2264 16 mmHg (criteria 2), IOP \u2264 14 mmHg (criteria 3) and \u2264 12 mmHg\r\n      (criteria 4) and/or IOP reduction by \u2265 30% of baseline IOP (last IOP measurement immediately\r\n      before surgery) without IOP lowering medications (complete success) (qualifed success was\r\n      defned as IOP controlled according to the same criteria with/without IOP lowering\r\n      medications), without the need for further surgery for IOP reduction and without any vision\r\n      threatening complications or hypotony (IOP \u2264 5 mmHg).\r\n\r\n      Statistical analysis:\r\n\r\n      Data were analysed with IBM SPSS. Repeated measure ANOVA and paired t tests were used to\r\n      compare the preoperative and postoperative variables in each group. Assessment of the data\r\n      normality will be done using both histogram plot and Shapiro-Wilk's test. The comparison\r\n      between the two groups was done by Independent samples T test for numerical variables and\r\n      Chi-square test for categorical variables. Fisher's exact p values were chosen where there\r\n      was an expected count of less than 5. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted to estimate\r\n      the mean survival time and probabilities of failure at diferent follow-up stages in the both\r\n      groups.. For all tests, P value of less than 0.05 will be considered significant.\r\n\r\n      References\r\n\r\n        1. Quigley HA, Broman AT.

Currently, it is known that keratoconus and glaucoma are\r\n      ocular disease that are associated with biomechanical alterations of the cornea.

For these patients,\r\n      surgical intervention (e.g. corneal cross-linking) is performed, in case of disease\r\n      progression.

The main risk factor for\r\n      glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Reducing IOP slows down the progression of\r\n      the disease as several large multicenter trials have shown. Some patients, however, still\r\n      progress despite adequately controlled IOP. As such, there is considerable interest in\r\n      approaches that rescue RGCs independent of IOP, a strategy called neuroprotection. Although\r\n      this field was actively discovered in the last 20 years in the brain and the eye, no non-IOP\r\n      related treatment is clinically available to date. Various approaches are currently studied\r\n      in some detail. One interesting strategy focuses on the neurovascular unit.\r\n\r\n      The blood flow of the human retina is controlled by complex mechanisms that include myogenic,\r\n      metabolic and hormonal factors. The high consumption of oxygen in the human retina is crucial\r\n      for normal functioning of the organ. As in the brain, blood flow in the retina is also\r\n      controlled by neurovascular coupling. This means that the retina increases its blood flow to\r\n      regions in which neurons are activated. This is done in an effort to provide more oxygen and\r\n      glucose to the active neurons. In the recent years evidence has accumulated that astrocytes\r\n      play a key role in mediating this vasodilator signal.\r\n\r\n      In the brain, abnormalities in neurovascular coupling have been observed in diseases like\r\n      stroke, hypertension, spinal-cord injury and Alzheimer's disease. This break-down of\r\n      neurovascular coupling is considered to play a key role in neuronal death in these diseases.\r\n      In the retina, abnormalities in neurovascular coupling have been observed in diseases as\r\n      diabetes and glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Most of the data obtained in the human retina stem from a system that measures retinal\r\n      vasodilatation during stimulation with flickering light. The investigators have previously\r\n      shown that flicker stimulation of the retina is, however, also associated with a pronounced\r\n      increase in retinal blood velocities. In this study the investigators employed laser Doppler\r\n      velocimetry (LDV) for the measurement of retinal blood velocities, but this technique is not\r\n      clinically applicable because it requires excellent fixation of the subject under study. In\r\n      the present study, the investigators propose to use an alternative system for neurovascular\r\n      coupling that they have developed recently. In this approach, the investigators use\r\n      bi-directional Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography for the assessment of retinal\r\n      blood flow. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive optical imaging modality\r\n      enabling cross-sectional tomographic in vivo visualization of internal microstructure in\r\n      biological systems. In ophthalmology, OCT has become a standard tool in visualizing the\r\n      retina and nowadays is considered also as a standard tool in the diagnosis of retinal\r\n      disease. In the recent years, conventional time domain OCT was replaced by Fourier domain OCT\r\n      providing significantly improved signal quality.\r\n\r\n      This bidirectional system overcomes the limitations of previously realized techniques, which\r\n      include doubtful validity and limited reproducibility. In addition, pattern ERG, multifocal\r\n      ERG and oscillatory potentials will be measured to allow for concomitant assessment of neural\r\n      function.\r\n\r\n      The investigators seek to measure neurovascular coupling in the human retina in patients with\r\n      early primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), normal tension glaucoma, ocular hypertension and a\r\n      healthy control group. In order to obtain information on neurovascular coupling, both\r\n      neuronal function as well as retinal blood flow need to be measured. In the present study,\r\n      the investigators will employ pattern ERG, multifocal ERG as well as oscillatory potentials\r\n      to assess the function of the inner retina. Retinal blood flow through major retinal arterial\r\n      and venous branch vessels will be measured before, during and after flicker stimulation with\r\n      the dual-beam bidirectional Fourier Domain Doppler OCT coupled to the commercially available\r\n      Dynamic Vessel Analyzer (DVA) produced by IMEDOS, Jena, Germany, which provides adequate\r\n      resolution to study the retinal circulation.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT02835482", "minimum_age": null, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["cataract"], "exclusion": ["diabetes", "hypertension", "multiple_sclerosis", "graves'disease", "sarcoidosis", "neurodegenerative_disease"], "brief_title": "Effect of Elevated Intraocular Pressure in Glaucoma Patients During Femtolaser Cataract Surgery", "brief_summary": "\n      The use of the femtosecond laser causes an increase in the intraocular pressure (IOP) between\r\n      100 mm Hg and 200 mm Hg for a period of about 80 seconds (suction phase).\r\n\r\n      If it is known that elevated IOP accelerates the degradation of retinal ganglion cells, whose\r\n      axons form the optic nerve.\r\n\r\n      No data has been published to date on potential adverse effects of femtolaser cataract\r\n      surgery performed in patients with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.\r\n\r\n      Since some time, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT) provides a detailed\r\n      analysis of ganglion cell complex (GCC) for which the loss is a marker of glaucomatous optic\r\n      neuropathy.

The most common form of glaucoma,\r\n      open-angle glaucoma, is incipient and typically results in a progressive loss of vision\r\n      without symptoms due to damage to a structure inside the eye called the optic nerve head.\r\n      Although the most important known risk factor for the development of open-angle glaucoma is\r\n      high intraocular pressure (the pressure within the eyeball), a number of researchers have\r\n      shown that a sizeable proportion of patients continue to lose vision in spite of successful\r\n      treatment to lower their intraocular pressure.

Therefore, the understanding of nighttime\r\n      IOP and the aqueous humor dynamics that control it has important scientific, clinical, and\r\n      commercial implications.\r\n\r\n      Previous research on glaucoma medications has been limited to the effects of ocular\r\n      hypotensive drugs on 24-hour IOP or daytime aqueous humor dynamics. Few studies have\r\n      evaluated nocturnal aqueous humor dynamics. The investigators recently completed studies of\r\n      day and night differences in aqueous humor dynamics in patients treated with drugs from three\r\n      different classes that include a prostaglandin analog, a beta blocker and a carbonic\r\n      anhydrase inhibitor. The current study is designed to elucidate the physiological mechanisms\r\n      driving the efficacy of brimonidine, an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, throughout the 24-hour\r\n      period, i.e. circadian rhythms in aqueous humor dynamics. Based on what the investigators\r\n      know of 24 hour IOPs this drug is expected to work well at night potentially by enhancing\r\n      uveoscleral outflow. This study will test this hypothesis.\r\n\r\n      In studies of new glaucoma medications the preferred study population includes ocular\r\n      hypertensive subjects. These people have high IOP but no optic nerve damage and no glaucoma.\r\n      They may be taking prescribed IOP lowering drugs for this condition or they may not. Those\r\n      taking ocular drugs are asked to stop taking them. Since glaucoma drugs affect aqueous humor\r\n      dynamics in different ways, it is essential that no residual medical effect remains from\r\n      these drugs. A washout period is necessary to remove all topical ocular drug effects. A\r\n      concern for patient safety exists when OHT patients are taken off of glaucoma medications, as\r\n      IOP may rise during the washout period. In order to monitor IOP in these patients, a biweekly\r\n      check of the IOP is made. If pressure rises above the ophthalmologist's preset \"target\r\n      pressure\" at any point, then the patient is removed from the study and returned to his/her\r\n      previous medical regimen.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00578110", "minimum_age": 40.0, "maximium_age": 75.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": [], "exclusion": ["eye_disease", "glaucoma"], "brief_title": "Instrument for Glaucoma Early Detection and Monitoring", "brief_summary": "\n      To introduce a rapid and objective electrophysiological technique that can assess visual\r\n      function in the magnocellular pathway, which is thought to be affected in early-stage\r\n      glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      The clinical study will evaluate a novel instrument designed to record visual evoked\r\n      potentials elicited by stimuli determined in prior research (Greenstein et al., 1998; Badr et\r\n      al., 2003) to drive select visual pathways that exhibit glaucomatous damage in an efficient\r\n      and automated manner.

Therefore, the\r\n      primary approach to managing this disease process is through intraocular pressure reduction\r\n      with a) topical drops that decrease intraocular fluid production or increase fluid outflow,\r\n      b) laser therapy to the outflow structures in the eye (trabecular meshwork) to increase fluid\r\n      egression, c) or incisional surgery with or without placement of setons to create a new\r\n      pathway for fluid outflow. When medical therapy has been maximized or patients do not\r\n      tolerate topical therapy, laser trabeculoplasty is common applied to achieve further\r\n      intraocular pressure reduction.

It remains a disease with an unclear and complex\r\n      underlying pathophysiology. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main and only modifiable risk\r\n      factor for glaucoma [2]. Although lowering IOP helps to decelerate or stabilize the disease,\r\n      a vast number of patients still show signs of glaucoma despite an IOP within normal range.\r\n      Clearly other pathogenetic mechanisms beyond IOP are involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma\r\n      for certain individuals. Non-IOP factors such as lower systolic ocular perfusion pressure\r\n      (OPP), reduced ocular blood flow, cardiovascular disease, and low systolic blood pressure\r\n      (BP) have been identified as risk factors for primary open-open-angle glaucoma (POAG) [3-6].\r\n      Evidence shows that non-IOP factors can impact the apoptotic process associated with glaucoma\r\n      [7].\r\n\r\n      Recently, researchers have emphasized not only IOP or vascular dysregulation, but also\r\n      intracranial pressure's (ICP) role in glaucoma [8-10]. The optic nerve is exposed not only to\r\n      IOP in the eye, but also to ICP as it is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the\r\n      subarachnoid space. Because the lamina cribrosa separates these two pressurized regions [11],\r\n      the decrease in pressure that occurs across the lamina cribrosa (IOP-ICP) is known as the\r\n      translaminar pressure gradient (TPG). A higher TPG may lead to abnormal function and optic\r\n      nerve damage due to changes in axonal transportation, deformation of the lamina cribrosa,\r\n      altered blood flow, or a combination thereof leading to glaucomatous damage. Besides, TPG may\r\n      be the primarily pressure-related parameter for glaucoma [12-15], since the ONH is located at\r\n      the junction between the intraocular space and the orbital retrobulbar space.\r\n\r\n      However, the role of TPG still remains unknown, because only invasive ICP measurements are\r\n      available within the contemporary medicine (lumbar puncture or punction of brain\r\n      ventricles-for patients with severe brain injury). The ideas for noninvasive ICP measurement\r\n      have been appearing since about 1980. Numerous methods for finding the objects or\r\n      physiological characteristics of cerebrospinal system that would be related to the ICP and\r\n      its monitoring have been sought by many authors. Most of the proposed technologies were based\r\n      on ultrasound and were capable of monitoring blood flow in intracranial or intraocular\r\n      vessels, cranium diameter, or acoustic properties of the cranium [16]. Broad research has\r\n      extended into sonography of optic nerve sheath and its relation with elevated ICP [17].\r\n      However, most of these correlation-based methods had the same problem-the need of individual\r\n      patient specific calibration.

A versatile hormone, insulin readily\r\n      crosses the blood-brain-barrier and influences numerous brain processes. In a mouse model of\r\n      optic nerve transection, our team showed that insulin administration after optic nerve injury\r\n      promoted robust dendritic regrowth, RGCs survival and retinal responses rescue, providing the\r\n      first evidence of successful dendrite regeneration in mammalian neurons. Our research\r\n      validates insulin as a powerful medication to restore dendritic function in glaucoma, forming\r\n      the basis for using insulin as glaucoma treatment in humans.\r\n\r\n      Currently, insulin is approved for diabetes. Adverse events of systemic insulin include\r\n      hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, lipodystrophy, allergies, weight gain, peripheral edema and drug\r\n      interactions. Experimental use of ocular topical insulin have been tested in small cohorts of\r\n      healthy individuals and diabetic patients, reporting no significant adverse events. However,\r\n      these protocols varied in insulin posology and adverse events were only touched upon briefly,\r\n      indicating the necessity to better characterize the safety profile of such off-label use of\r\n      insulin before its application as a neuroprotective and regenerative treatment for glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      In this study, the investigators hypothesize that topical ocular insulin (up to 500 U/ml) at\r\n      once per day dosing is safe in patients with open angle glaucoma.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Glaucoma: a major health care challenge of the 21st century\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is expected to affect 76\r\n      million people by the year 2020. In glaucoma, there is a permanent loss of retinal ganglion\r\n      cells (RGCs), the long-projecting central nervous system (CNS) neurons that convey visual\r\n      information from the retina to the brain via their axons. Clinically, such changes translate\r\n      into a progressive damage of visual field and sometimes result in a complete loss of vision.\r\n      Currently, intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction remains the sole target of proven glaucoma\r\n      therapies, consisting of a wide range of eye drops, systemic medications, laser procedures\r\n      and incisional surgeries. However, many patients continue to lose vision even when these\r\n      therapies are implemented, exemplifying the unmet need for novel therapies that sustain RGC\r\n      survival and stimulate their regeneration.\r\n\r\n      Dendrite pathology: an early sign of neuronal damage in glaucoma Dendrites are specialized\r\n      processes that determine how neurons receive and integrate information within neuronal\r\n      circuits. Dendrite retraction and synapse disassembly are early signs of pathology in several\r\n      psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Dendritic pathology occurs prior to soma or axon\r\n      loss and correlates with substantial functional deficits. In mammals, CNS neurons have a\r\n      limited capacity to regenerate after injury. While a large number of studies have focused on\r\n      axonal regeneration, the ability of mammalian neurons to regrow dendrites and reestablish\r\n      functional synapses has been largely ignored. This is a critical issue because pathological\r\n      disconnection from pre-synaptic targets leads to persistent functional impairment and accrued\r\n      neuronal death, contributing to vision loss in glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      The role of insulin in dendrite regeneration Aberrant or insufficient insulin signaling, even\r\n      in the absence of diabetes, has been associated with neurodegeneration in diseases\r\n      characterized by dendritic pathology, notably Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as\r\n      glaucoma. Traditionally viewed solely as a peripherally acting hormone, insulin crosses the\r\n      blood-brain-barrier readily and can influence a number of physiological brain processes\r\n      including neuronal survival, neurotransmission, and cognitive performance. Using a model of\r\n      optic nerve transection (axotomy), members of our team (Agostinone et al. Brain 2018) showed\r\n      that insulin administered as eye drops or systemically after dendrites had retracted,\r\n      promoted robust dendritic growth that restored arbor area and complexity. Remarkably, insulin\r\n      rescued excitatory postsynaptic sites and light-triggered retinal responses while promoting\r\n      robust cell survival. This study provides the first evidence of successful dendrite\r\n      regeneration in mammalian neurons. Unpublished data (manuscript in preparation) from a mouse\r\n      glaucoma model by our colleagues at the CHUM (Agostinone et al., in preparation) also showed\r\n      that insulin stimulates similar dendrite regeneration after ocular hypertension damage. These\r\n      results confirm that injured murine RGCs can effectively regenerate dendrites and validate\r\n      insulin as a powerful strategy to restore dendritic morphology in glaucoma, providing the\r\n      basis for need of further investigation of insulin use as glaucoma treatment in humans.\r\n\r\n      Currently, insulin is approved for subcutaneous or intravenous use as a treatment for\r\n      diabetes mellitus. Adverse events of systemic insulin include hypoglycemia,\r\n      hypokalemia,allergies, weight gain, peripheral edema and drug interactions. Experimental use\r\n      of ocular topical insulin have been tested in small cohorts of healthy individuals and\r\n      diabetic patients, reporting no significant adverse events. However, these protocols varied\r\n      in insulin posology and adverse events were only mentioned briefly, if at all, in most of\r\n      these studies, indicating the necessity of better characterizing the safety profile of such\r\n      off-label use of insulin prior to implementing its use as neuroprotective and regenerative\r\n      treatment for glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Experimental nature of the medication / treatment:\r\n\r\n      Topical application of insulin with concentrations of 100 U/ml (Humulin R U-100, Eli Lilly\r\n      Canada, St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and 500 U/ml (Entuzity, Eli Lilly Canada, St-Laurent,\r\n      Quebec, Canada) once per day to eyes diagnosed with open angle glaucoma. Both products of\r\n      insulin are approved by Health Canada for subcutaneous and intravenous use for the treatment\r\n      of diabetes mellitus.

Trabeculectomy has shown poor long-term outcomes for refractory glaucoma,\r\n      making shunt surgery a better alternative. [1]Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) is effective\r\n      procedure in management of refractory glaucoma with long-term follow-up in Egyptian\r\n      patients.[2] AGV, a shunt device, is used either initially or after conventional procedures\r\n      fail to treat refractory glaucoma. It helps the aqueous humor flow directly into the silicone\r\n      tube.[3] Encapsulation of the AGV is an early complication especially in pediatric patients\r\n      leading to postoperative elevation of intraocular pressure [4]. Encapsulation inhibits the\r\n      fluid drainage leading to failure of the procedure. The valve mechanism is blocked by\r\n      contracted scar tissue, but the device itself is not affected by the encapsulation..[5] The\r\n      reasons for this excessive fibrotic reaction and capsule impermeability are not fully\r\n      understood. Apart from implant properties, such as size, shape, surface properties and\r\n      biomaterial other mechanisms leading to collagen distribution, proliferation and adhesion of\r\n      fibroblasts have been suggested to contribute to the encapsulation process .[6]\r\n\r\n      Different techniques were developed for revision of this encapsulated bleb. Surgical excision\r\n      of the capsule immediately leads to an aqueous flow and drop of intraocular pressure [4, 7],\r\n      but it carries the risk of reformation of the capsule again. Bleb needle revision is another\r\n      method that targets the fibrosis tissue and has long been employed in the treatment of\r\n      encapsulated bleb following trabeculectomy. Despite the favorable outcomes after\r\n      trabeculectomy, this modality is not generally used after AGV implantation. A few reports\r\n      have investigated the application of needle revision in AGVs[8] Using antimetabolites as\r\n      mitomycin c and 5-FU during needling over the plate of an AGV may also be an effective and\r\n      safe choice in patients with elevated IOP due to encapsulation or fibrosis.[9] Aim of the\r\n      Study This study aims to assess the safety and efficacy of supracapsular Ahmed Glaucoma Valve\r\n      plate delivery for management of encapsulated bleb in pediatric patients with failed Ahmed\r\n      Glaucoma Valve.\r\n\r\n      Patient and methods This is a prospective interventional study.

Hypothesis The hypothesis of this study is that combined trabeculectomy,\r\n      phacoemulsification and IOL implantation has more effect on corneal endothelial cell loss\r\n      than trabeculectomy alone.\r\n\r\n      4. Research Plan 4.1 Study Design This is a prospective, interventional comparative clinical\r\n      study\r\n\r\n      4.2 Patients Patients for this study will be recruited from the John and Liz Tory Eye Centre,\r\n      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (SHSC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All patients will\r\n      require and have consented to incisional glaucoma surgery with or without cataract surgery\r\n      prior to being recruited. Subjects will be placed in one of two groups (Group A:\r\n      Trabeculectomy only and Group B: Combined Surgery) based on absence or presence of\r\n      cataract-impaired visual acuity. After achieving consent, for all patients undergoing the\r\n      study, baseline information including age, gender, number of anti-glaucoma medications and\r\n      medical history will be recorded. All patients will receive an ocular examination, including\r\n      best corrected visual acuity measurement (Snellen chart), slit lamp examination along with\r\n      tonometry (Goldmann applanation tonometry), central corneal thickness measurement\r\n      (Pachymeter) and specular microscopy photos at pre-op, 1 month and 3 month visits. Anterior\r\n      chamber depth will be measured by The IOLMaster\u00ae (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany) for all\r\n      patients on pre-op visit. Type of the cataract will be assessed and recorded for Group B in\r\n      pre-op visit. All achieved data will be recorded and saved on prepared data sheet for future\r\n      analysis.\r\n\r\n      4.2-1 Inclusion criteria\r\n\r\n        1. Age over 18 years old\r\n\r\n        2.

Pre-operation corneal disease\r\n\r\n      The investigators may decide to remove a patient from this study for any of the following\r\n      reason(s):\r\n\r\n      \u2022 Need for any other ocular surgery known to have effects on corneal endothelial health\r\n\r\n      4.3 Surgical procedure\r\n\r\n      4.3 A: Trabeculectomy\r\n\r\n      The primary investigator and/or a glaucoma fellow will perform a standard trabeculectomy.\r\n      After receiving a peribulbar block on identified eye, the patient will be transferred to OR\r\n      and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.\r\n\r\n      A traction suture (6-0 silk) will be put in peripheral cornea after a lid speculum is\r\n      inserted. A superior conjunctival peritomy will be performed followed by bipolar cautery for\r\n      haemostasis. At this point 0.2 mg/ml Mitomycin-C will be applied using 3 soaked sponges\r\n      tucked under conjunctival flap which will be removed after 90 seconds while checking the time\r\n      by a digital timer. Copious irrigation with 20 cc sterile saline will be performed after.\r\n\r\n      A 4 in 4 mm scleral flap will be demarcated by a diamond blade at the depth of 0.25 mm. The\r\n      flap will be elevated and dissected through the clear cornea using a crescent blade. After\r\n      creating a side port to decompress the anterior chamber by a 25-gauge needle, sclerotomy will\r\n      be performed using a 15 degrees blade followed by a peripheral iridotomy. The scleral flap\r\n      will be sutured back into place using 4-8 interrupted and buried 10-0 nylon sutures.\r\n\r\n      Anterior chamber (AC) will be reformed by balanced sterile saline (BSS) which reveals\r\n      filtration through the flap. Conjunctival flap will be repositioned meticulously into the\r\n      limbus using either continuous alone or with combination of interrupted 8-0 Vicryl sutures.\r\n      6-0 silk traction suture and speculum will be removed after reforming AC again to confirm no\r\n      leak from the wound site. The eye will be patched using an eye patch and a plastic shield\r\n      after application of TobraDex\u00ae ointment and Atropine 1% eye drop (if Phakic).\r\n\r\n      4.3 B: Combined Trabeculectomy, Phacoemulsification and IOL implantation\r\n\r\n      The primary investigator and/or a glaucoma fellow will perform Combined trabeculectomy,\r\n      phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. After receiving peribulbar block on identified eye,\r\n      pt will be transferred to OR and prepped and draped in the usual fashion.\r\n\r\n      A traction suture (6-0 silk) will be put in peripheral cornea after a lid speculum is\r\n      inserted.

The\r\n      flap will be elevated and dissected through the clear cornea using a crescent blade.\r\n\r\n      After the side port is made using 15 degree blade, the entrance to the anterior chamber (AC)\r\n      will be made using 2.4 mm keratome. Capsulorrhexis will be performed using a cyctotome after\r\n      filling the anterior chamber with viscoelastic (Viscost\u00ae and Provisc\u00ae). Lens material will be\r\n      extracted using phacoemulsification and completed by irrigation and aspiration of the cortex\r\n      material. The capsular bag will be inflated using Provisc and Posterior Chamber Intra-Ocular\r\n      Lens (PCIOL) will be inserted using the PCIOL dispenser in to the bag and dialed in place by\r\n      a Sinskey hook. Completion of sclerotomy and creation of a peripheral iridectomy will be\r\n      followed by using a 20 degree blade and Vannas scissors.\r\n\r\n      The scleral flap will be sutured back into place using 4-8 interrupted and buried 10-0 nylon\r\n      sutures. AC will be reformed by balanced sterile saline (BSS) which reveals filtration\r\n      through the flap.

Most of these patients are\r\n      at high risk for surgical failure, with serious concomitant ocular and systemic diseases.\r\n      GDD's are increasingly being used to obtain low target intraocular pressures (IOP) in\r\n      patients who have failed antimetabolite trabeculectomy or have active neovascular glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Since Molteno's original design, several drainage devices have become commercially available\r\n      for implantation. Currently, the two most commonly used devices are the Ahmed Glaucoma Valve\r\n      (AGV) (New World Medical, Inc., Rancho Cucamonga, CA), and the Baerveldt Glaucoma Device\r\n      (BGD) (Advanced Medical Optics, Santa Ana, CA). The AGV, with a venture-based\r\n      flow-restrictive valve is helpful in minimizing postoperative hypotony and complications\r\n      associated with hypotony, including flat anterior chamber, choroidal effusions, and\r\n      suprachoroidal hemorrhage. However, there appears to be a high rate of encapsulation and\r\n      hypertension associated with this device, and increased requirement of postoperative glaucoma\r\n      medication use. The BGD, a non-valved device, requires early ligature of flow by the use of a\r\n      suture restriction to allow adequate time for bleb formation. Although this can result in an\r\n      initial post-operative hypertension phase, it results in less encapsulation and theoretically\r\n      fewer postoperative glaucoma medications and better IOP control. However, the lack of a\r\n      flow-restrictor and the large filtering surface area may result in a greater risk for\r\n      hypotony related complications.\r\n\r\n      Although several studies comparing the AGV and BGD have been reported, they have all been\r\n      retrospective, nonrandomized, small scale, and compare different patient populations. The\r\n      results have been inconclusive and conflicting in evaluating the relative efficacy and\r\n      characteristics of these two devices, and further research needs to be done in order to\r\n      answer these questions.\r\n\r\n      Objective:\r\n\r\n      The Ahmed vs. Baerveldt (AVB) Study is the first multicenter prospective randomized clinical\r\n      trial comparing the Ahmed FP7 valve and the Baerveldt-350 tube shunt glaucoma drainage\r\n      devices. Primary outcome is surgical failure, a composite criteria evaluating the intraocular\r\n      pressure lowering effect of the devices, complications of the surgery, treatments for\r\n      complications, glaucoma medication use, and the preservation of visual acuity.

Statistical analysis of the study data.\r\n\r\n      Methods:\r\n\r\n      Patient Enrollment and Treatment Assignment:\r\n\r\n      Patients were recruited from 7 study sites by 10 surgeons. After patient eligibility and\r\n      written informed consent was obtained by the Site PI, randomization to placement of an Ahmed\r\n      FP7 valve or a Baerveldt-350 tube shunt was made by coin toss.\r\n\r\n      Pre-operative data collection:\r\n\r\n      The following data was collected in the 3 months prior to surgery: date of birth, gender,\r\n      race, glaucoma diagnosis and etiology, past ocular history (diagnoses, surgical and laser\r\n      procedures), best corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, glaucoma medication use,\r\n      abnormal slit lamp findings, and abnormal fundus exam findings.\r\n\r\n      Surgical Procedure:\r\n\r\n      The surgical procedures used for the AVB Study are standardized, and any complications during\r\n      surgery will be noted and defined.\r\n\r\n      Ahmed FP7 valve implantation:\r\n\r\n      A superior or inferior corneal traction suture with 8-0 Vicryl was placed for globe fixation\r\n      as required. A 90-degree conjunctival peritomy was followed by blunt dissection to mobilize a\r\n      fornix or limbus-based conjunctival flap over the area of intended device implantation.\r\n      Non-preserved lidocaine 1% was injected under the conjunctival flap, posteriorly, and under\r\n      the extraocular muscle bellies with a blunt cannula. Gentle cautery was used to obtain\r\n      hemostasis.\r\n\r\n      The Ahmed Glaucoma Valve model FP-7 was primed with balanced salt solution, and placed in the\r\n      intended quadrant. The plate was sutured to sclera 8-10mm posterior to the limbus with two\r\n      8-0 or 10-0 Nylon sutures.\r\n\r\n      A paracentesis was made if required, and a viscoelastic agent used to form the anterior\r\n      chamber. A 22-gauge needle was used to create needle tract into the anterior chamber.\r\n\r\n      The tube was trimmed, and placed into the anterior chamber through the needle tract. The tube\r\n      was attached to the sclera using a 10-0 Nylon suture if required.

This contact\r\n      between iris and trabecular meshwork (TM) may gradually damage the function of the meshwork\r\n      until it fails to keep pace with aqueous production, and the pressure rises, and at last the\r\n      optic nerve is damaged, the vision may be lost in some severe cases. Therefore, ocular\r\n      pressure reduction is the key to treat the disease and prevent blindness. Trabeculectomy is\r\n      the most common conventional surgery performed for glaucoma. This allows fluid to flow out of\r\n      the eye through this opening, resulting in lowered intraocular pressure(IOP) and the\r\n      formation of a bleb or fluid bubble on the surface of the eye.\r\n\r\n      Cataract surgery is common in the elderly. Cataract surgery is the removal of the natural\r\n      lens of the eye (also called \"crystalline lens\") that has developed an opacification, which\r\n      is referred to as a cataract. Cataract extraction includes intracapsular cataract extraction,\r\n      extra capsular cataract extraction & phacoemulsification, and phacoemulsification is the\r\n      preferred method. It has been reported that IOP reduction could occur in cataract patients\r\n      with PACG after the cataract surgery. For some cases with PACG, such IOP reduction may be\r\n      insufficient for neuronal protection, and many patients still require glaucoma medication and\r\n      incisional surgery such as trabeculectomy to control IOP. In such cases, a combined\r\n      cataract-glaucoma procedure (phacotrabeculectomy) is a reasonable option. In keeping with\r\n      this concept, previous studies have shown that phacotrabeculectomy could effectively and\r\n      simultaneously reduce IOP and improve vision in patients with a coexistence of PACG and\r\n      vision-threatening cataract.

In glaucoma, vision is lost through apoptosis (programmed cell death) of retinal\r\n      ganglion cells, a type of cell in the retina that transmits visual information to the brain.\r\n      Diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on a combination of progressive, characteristic vision\r\n      loss (measured using visual field testing) and progressive optic nerve head damage (as\r\n      detected through dilated fundus examinations or disc photography). While a high pressure\r\n      inside the eye (ocular hypertension, OHT) is not sufficient for a diagnosis of glaucoma, it\r\n      is the greatest single risk factor for disease onset.\r\n\r\n      Currently, the only effective treatment to prevent disease progression is lowering of the\r\n      intraocular pressure (IOP). IOP is determined by the balance between aqueous production\r\n      (flow) and aqueous outflow through either the trabecular meshwork or uveoscleral pathway.\r\n      Diurnal rhythms in aqueous humor dynamics and nocturnal fluctuations in IOP and aqueous flow\r\n      have been studied in some detail9 but little is known about the nocturnal rhythms of aqueous\r\n      humor outflow.\r\n\r\n      Usually, clinical IOP measurement is performed during the day; little is known about\r\n      nocturnal IOP fluctuations in relation to glaucoma management . A recent surge of interest in\r\n      nocturnal IOPs stems from the hypothesis that significant glaucomatous damage may occur at\r\n      night. In response, some investigators have advocated particular classes of glaucoma\r\n      medications based on their nocturnal IOP effects. The most efficacious drug on the market may\r\n      not be the preferred treatment if it is ineffective at night. Therefore, the understanding of\r\n      nighttime IOP and the aqueous humor dynamics that control it has important scientific,\r\n      clinical, and commercial implications.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, previous research on glaucoma medications has been limited to the effects\r\n      ocular hypotensive drugs on 24-hour IOP or daytime aqueous humor dynamics; few studies have\r\n      addressed their effect on nocturnal aqueous humor dynamics. Beta-blockers have been proven\r\n      effective in lowering IOP during the day by decreasing aqueous flow. However, limitations\r\n      have been found in their IOP-lowering effect overnight. Prostaglandins, which increase\r\n      uveoscleral outflow, seem to possess a hypotensive effect that is constant throughout the\r\n      24-hour period. Dorzolamide reduces aqueous flow to lower IOP but few studies have addressed\r\n      its effect at night. This study is designed to elucidate the physiological mechanisms driving\r\n      the efficacy of these drugs throughout the 24-hour period, i.e. circadian rhythms in aqueous\r\n      humor dynamics.\r\n\r\n      In studies of new glaucoma medications the preferred study population includes ocular\r\n      hypertensive subjects. These people have high IOP but no optic nerve damage and no glaucoma.\r\n      They may be taking prescribed IOP lowering drugs for this condition or they may not. Those\r\n      taking ocular drugs are asked to stop taking them. Since each of the glaucoma drugs affects\r\n      aqueous humor dynamics in different ways, it is essential that no residual medical effect\r\n      remains from these drugs. Standard washout periods of 6-weeks will be utilized in between\r\n      drug assessments. This period of time is based on the methods of other published studies\r\n      which determined a necessary period of 4-8 weeks for ocular washout of prostaglandins. A\r\n      concern for patient safety exists when OHT patients are taken off of glaucoma medications, as\r\n      IOP may rise during the washout. In order to monitor IOP in these patients, most study\r\n      methods utilize a biweekly check of the IOP. If pressure rises above the ophthalmologist's\r\n      preset \"target pressure\" at any point, then the patient is removed from the study and\r\n      returned to their previous medical regimen.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00338065", "minimum_age": 10.0, "maximium_age": 90.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["autonomic_dysfunction", "open-angle_glaucoma", "normal", "glaucoma"], "exclusion": [], "brief_title": "External Influences Upon Ocular Homeostasis", "brief_summary": "\n      Our experiments are designed to test the overall hypothesis that position-dependent or\r\n      water-dependent intra-ocular pressure (IOP) spikes occur in humans, and that these challenge\r\n      ocular homeostasis.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the United States, yet its pathogenesis\r\n      is poorly understood.

The World Health Organization estimates that by 2020 the number of cases for\r\n      blindness due to glaucoma will double to 12 million. The financial impact of glaucoma on the\r\n      US economy is more than $1.5 billion annually.\r\n\r\n      Glaucoma can be managed through several intra ocular pressure (IOP) lowering medications\r\n      including Pfizer's XALATAN\u00ae (latanoprost), which accounted for 27% of the total US market in\r\n      Jan 2010. Effective management however requires patient-compliance, which is frequently low\r\n      for eye drop based therapies. The compliance is less than 50% for glaucoma eye drops, and\r\n      even lower for multiple drops and/or multiple drug therapies. In a recent study with 204\r\n      glaucoma patients, only 71% were able to instill the drop into the eye, with only 39% doing\r\n      it without touching the bottle to the eye surface. The lack of patient-compliance to glaucoma\r\n      therapy arises from several sources. Firstly, due to the chronic nature of the disease,\r\n      patients on glaucoma medication cannot immediately discern the benefits of taking the\r\n      medication regularly, and so they are not sufficiently motivated to be compliant. Even for\r\n      patients that regularly take the medicine through eye drops, the compliance can be far from\r\n      perfect due to the difficulties in instilling eye drops.\r\n\r\n      In addition to the lack of compliance, low bioavailability of glaucoma drugs delivered\r\n      through eye drops is a major problem, which can lead to side effects ranging from irritation\r\n      and the unpleasant taste to debilitating effects such as heart problems. The corneal\r\n      bioavailability of glaucoma drugs ranges in 1-5% because of the rapid tear turn over\r\n      accompanied by drug transport into the conjunctiva, which has a larger area and permeability\r\n      compared to cornea. The conjunctival and nasal absorption leads to systemic exposure in all\r\n      tissues, and thus leading to potential side effects. The presence of preservatives such as\r\n      benzalkonium chloride (BAK) further contributes to toxicity from eye drops.\r\n\r\n      The deficiencies of the eye drop formulations for glaucoma therapy were addressed by Ocusert\u00ae\r\n      (Alza), a highly successful pilocarpine releasing ocular insert that was placed in the cul de\r\n      sac of the eye. Ocusert\u00ae was shown in clinical studies to produce a constant reduction in IOP\r\n      for over 7 days 23. The total dosage of pilocarpine administered by one Ocusert\u00ae system over\r\n      7-days was about one-eighth of the amount provided by the 28 applications (4 each day) of the\r\n      2% eyedrops. The simplified regimen and reduced side effects from Ocusert\u00ae encouraged patient\r\n      compliance. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of Ocusert\u00ae has discontinued making them likely\r\n      due to some drawbacks of the device including retention problems, twisting to change shape,\r\n      sight impediment due to dislocation of the device in front of the pupil, but most important a\r\n      sudden burst release in 0.4% of cases that could cause toxicity. Additionally, pilocarpine\r\n      has been replaced by several newer drugs such as prostaglandins as the first line of defense\r\n      against glaucoma. Our goal in this proposed research is to replicate the success of Ocusert\u00ae\r\n      with a newer drug and a different device design to eliminate the drawbacks of Ocusert\u00ae. To\r\n      improve compliance and reduce side effects, we propose to develop a drug delivery system that\r\n      has excellent retention and biocompatibility, with continuous release of drugs for extended\r\n      durations, with high bioavailability and with no possibility of drug leakage.\r\n\r\n      Contact lenses have the highest possible bioavailability for cornea because drug released by\r\n      contact lenses is trapped in the thin post lens tear film between the cornea and the lens for\r\n      extended period longer than 30 minutes, compared to 2-5 minutes for eye drops. The increased\r\n      residence time leads to very high fractional drug uptake by cornea, which reduces the needed\r\n      dose, thereby improving the safety profile. The use of contact lenses for treating glaucoma\r\n      will also result in very high compliance for the patients who also need vision correction\r\n      because they will always insert the lens for the vision correction, even if they do not\r\n      immediately appreciate the benefits of the IOP reduction. Additional benefits of contact lens\r\n      based drug delivery will be elimination of the preservatives in the multi-use eye drop\r\n      formulations, which can cause discomfort and redness. Finally, contact lenses are the most\r\n      commonly used medical devices with over 41 million wearers in the United States and over five\r\n      decades of history of safe use. Based on all these considerations, drug loaded contact lenses\r\n      could be very promising for delivery of ophthalmic drugs.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT05405868", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["open-angle_glaucoma", "oag", "tension_glaucoma", "ntg", "pseudoexfoliation_glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["pigment_dispersion_glaucoma", "isoniazid", "pyrazinamide", "carbamazepine", "liver_disease", "renal_failure", "diabetic_retinopathy", "retinal_disease", "vf", "cataract", "dementia", "laucomatousurological_disease", "blepharochalasis", "cancer", "glaucoma", "vitamin_b3", "nam", "coenzyme_q10"], "brief_title": "Nicotinamide in Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      Glaucoma is the leading cause of sight impairment and blindness worldwide.

Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is the most common type of\r\n      glaucoma. This tends to develop slowly over many years, caused by the drainage pathway in the\r\n      eye gradually becoming blocked over time due to a build-up of fluid. This build-up causes\r\n      pressure in the eye to increase (intra-ocular pressure (IOP)), which then damages the\r\n      important nerve at the back of the eye called the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss.\r\n      Current treatments offered for glaucoma (eye drops or laser surgery), aim to lower eye\r\n      pressure and have shown to slow vision loss, however, visual disability and blindness rates\r\n      remain unacceptably high and many patients continue to lose vision despite these treatments,\r\n      suggesting that the optic nerve in some patients is more easily damaged.

This has led to a considerable body of research into neurodegenerative\r\n      mechanisms and potential neuroprotective approaches. Various pathways contributing to the\r\n      neurodegeneration have been implicated, and many have focussed on the role of mitochondria.\r\n      Neuroprotection would significantly reduce sight loss and the burden of IOP-lowering eye drop\r\n      treatment needed for disease control.

Glaucoma is currently considered to be a\r\n      progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Low-pressure glaucoma (LPG) is a type of open-angle\r\n      glaucoma (OAG) with progressive visual field and optic nerve damage despite an untreated eye\r\n      pressure in the statistically normal (mean 15.9, SD 2.9 mmHg) range, usually less than 21\r\n      mmHg. Therefore, in this condition, pressure-independent mechanisms (e.g., vascular or\r\n      structural defects of the optic nerve) may be the main, if not the sole, cause of the optic\r\n      neuropathy. LPG represents 6.7% to 68.3% of all OAGs.\r\n\r\n      Current glaucoma treatment is directed to lowering eye pressure using medical therapy (eye\r\n      drops), laser treatment, and/or surgery, to a level that stops progressive optic nerve\r\n      damage. The efficacy of lowering eye pressure in LPG has been reported. Both protocol medical\r\n      treatments, brimonidine and timolol, show similar efficacy to lower eye pressure.\r\n\r\n      Laboratory research over the past decade indicates the potential to manage glaucoma not only\r\n      by lowering eye pressure, but with treatment modalities aimed at the damage occurring at the\r\n      optic nerve. Possible therapies may include agents effective as neuronal protectants to\r\n      increase or prolong the survival rate of injured retinal ganglion cells. Treatments could\r\n      also be directed to the rescue of nerve fibers from secondary degeneration, as stimulants to\r\n      expand dendritic fields, and to promote nerve regeneration or neural transplantation.\r\n\r\n      Selective \u03b12-adrenergic agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in animal\r\n      models of focal cerebral ischemia. Brimonidine is reported to protect the optic nerve and\r\n      retinal ganglion cells from secondary degeneration following a partial crush lesion to the\r\n      adult rat optic nerve. One molecular mechanism for this neuroprotection may relate to\r\n      up-regulation of neuronal survival factors. In rats, systemic \u03b12-adrenergic agonists induce\r\n      basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA in the retina. Treatment with \u03b12-agonists before and\r\n      during constant light exposure reduces retinal photoreceptor degeneration in albino rats.\r\n      Animal studies demonstrate that topical administration of brimonidine results in\r\n      pharmacologic concentrations of drug in the vitreous (100-170 nM). Therefore, ocular dosing\r\n      with brimonidine provides a route for drug delivery to the retina in amounts sufficient to\r\n      bind and activate the \u03b12-adrenoceptor and provide a neuroprotective effect.\r\n\r\n      The study hypothesis is to evaluate the ability of topical treatment with 0.2% brimonidine, a\r\n      highly selective \u03b12-adrenergic agonist, to impart neuroprotection to the damaged optic nerve\r\n      in patients with LPG. Comparison is made to 0.5% timolol, a nonselective \u03b2-adrenergic\r\n      antagonist, without reported neuroprotective properties.

Estimated prevalence is\r\n      3.0%, making it the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Intraocular pressure\r\n      (IOP) is the only proven modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of POAG,\r\n      but even effective reduction of IOP by pharmacological or surgical means does not always\r\n      change the course of the disease or prevent some people from developing glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      OSA is a sleep-related breathing disorder (SBD) caused by complete (apnoea) or partial\r\n      (hypopnoea) narrowing of the upper airway, resulting in disturbed sleep and intermittent\r\n      oxygen desaturations. These in turn have negative impact on cardiovascular system and\r\n      potentially other organs. OSA is treated by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\r\n      applied by a nasal or a full face mask which maintains patency of the upper airway. CPAP is\r\n      the first line treatment for moderately severe and severe OSA and, among currently used\r\n      treatment modalities, it is also the most effective one. The prevalence of OSA continues to\r\n      increase linked with the rising global incidence of obesity, though many remain undiagnosed.\r\n      A recent study from the United States estimated that 35% of people between the ages of 50 and\r\n      70 years suffer from OSA, and approximately 12% may require treatment.\r\n\r\n      OSA and OAG are, therefore, two common conditions which may coexist in a significant\r\n      proportion of patients. In fact, some studies indicate increased prevalence of OAG in\r\n      patients with OSA, which is in line with a suspected causative role of OSA in glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      People with OAG and concomitant OSA associated with the relevant symptoms, particularly\r\n      daytime sleepiness, currently receive standard treatment with CPAP. However, the impact of\r\n      CPAP on their glaucoma is unknown. There are concerns that CPAP increases IOP, currently the\r\n      only modifiable factor in glaucoma, though the evidence for this is limited. The exact\r\n      mechanisms of the possible IOP-raising effect of CPAP are not clear. The favoured hypothesis\r\n      is CPAP leads to increases in intrathoracic pressure, which in turn raises pressure in the\r\n      venous circulation and a reduction in the aqueous humour outflow through the episcleral veins\r\n      and ultimately IOP increase. A similar mechanism is believed to be responsible for IOP\r\n      elevation in the transition from an upright to supine position in which venous drainage is\r\n      reduced.\r\n\r\n      The relationship between the level of pressure used in CPAP treatment and IOP has not been\r\n      studied. It is unknown if IOP increases in correlated way to CPAP or whether there is no\r\n      straightforward correlation. If the first is true, application of CPAP only up to a certain\r\n      pressure level would be safe and perhaps the threshold to use bi-level PAP should be lower in\r\n      patients with glaucoma. If, however, IOP changes are a matter of individual response to CPAP,\r\n      perhaps dependent on the severity of OSA or BMI, a routine measurement of the pressure should\r\n      be performed once CPAP is started. This is currently not a part of standard clinical\r\n      practice. It is also possible that CPAP set within the usual pressure range does not\r\n      influence IOP or its effect is not mediated by simple mechanical pressure transmission.\r\n\r\n      Therefore understanding the influence of CPAP on IOP is important as it may inform the\r\n      management of people with OSA and concomitant glaucoma. If CPAP is shown to raise IOP or\r\n      alter ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) to levels that pose clinical risk it will be necessary\r\n      to assess available alternative treatment options for OSA.\r\n\r\n      This is a prospective physiological controlled study which will assess IOP response to\r\n      several different CPAP levels applied for short periods in wakefulness in three groups of\r\n      people: POAG patients established on treatment (treated glaucoma group), newly diagnosed\r\n      treatment na\u00efve POAG patients (untreated glaucoma group) and control subjects without\r\n      glaucoma (control subjects).\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00485108", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open_angle_glaucoma", "exfoliation_glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["glaucoma"], "brief_title": "Anti-inflammatory Therapy Following Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty", "brief_summary": "\n      The type of anti-inflammatory medication used post selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) may\r\n      have an impact on the intra-ocular pressure (IOP) lowering effect of SLT.

Elevated intra-ocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor.\r\n\r\n      Corticosteroids, which are often used for the treatment of many diseases in ophthalmology and\r\n      other specialities, may cause an elevation of the IOP. It is estimated that corticosteroids\r\n      induce ocular hypertension in approximately 18%-36% of the general population and in patients\r\n      with POAG this percentage can be as high as 92%. When the treatment is sustained, this can\r\n      cause a glaucomatous neuropathy of the optic nerve (corticosteroid-induced glaucoma).\r\n\r\n      The precise pathogenic mechanism isn't clear yet.

Patients with vision loss as a result\r\n      of this disease may feel like they have been 'given up on', or lost to our medical system\r\n      when no further interventions can be offered to treat their eye disease. It is our intent to\r\n      investigate what alternatives we can provide our patients, instead of simply saying, 'nothing\r\n      more can be done'. We have learned from studies done on other chronic eye diseases, like age\r\n      related macular degeneration, that low vision rehabilitation can improve visual function.\r\n\r\n      What exactly is low vision? It can involve a loss of visual acuity, making activities such as\r\n      reading or writing a challenge; it can involve loss of contrast sensitivity, making shapes\r\n      and edges hard to discern, like those of a stair edge, or person's face. It could also\r\n      involve a loss of peripheral, or side vision which is a symptom common to most glaucoma\r\n      patients. Whatever the cause of low vision, doing day-to-day activities can become\r\n      increasingly difficult, and many suffer from a loss of their independence and may even become\r\n      depressed. Low vision rehabilitation involves helping patients to use their remaining vision\r\n      in optimal, and sometimes even new, ways. This involves an assessment of a person's baseline\r\n      vision, and an idea of what their needs are. Patients are then given low vision aids (such as\r\n      magnifiers, telescopes, video screens which magnify images, and other tools) as well as\r\n      instructions and support for adapting to living and functioning with altered vision.\r\n\r\n      Although there currently exists no cure for glaucoma, and we are certainly not promising a\r\n      reversal of the damage done to the eyes from this chronic disease, we do believe that these\r\n      types of rehabilitation services may offer some hope and potential visual benefit to patients\r\n      living with vision loss. Our hypothesis is that the use of state-of-the-art low vision aids\r\n      in patients with advanced glaucomatous visual loss will provide an improvement in visual\r\n      tasks and thereby an improvement in quality of life.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      Visual impairment, including both low vision and blindness, ranks among the ten most\r\n      prevalent causes of disability in North America (1). Leading causes of low vision are\r\n      diseases also associated with an aging population, including age related macular degeneration\r\n      (ARMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and optic neuropathies (1). Of these, irreversible\r\n      vision loss is most commonly caused by ARMD and glaucoma, diseases for which there exists no\r\n      cure (2). Quality of life and functional ability are negatively impacted by vision loss and\r\n      blindness (2). Loss of visual ability impairs both mental and physical functioning, limiting\r\n      activities of daily living (ADL) (eating, dressing, reading, writing, mobilizing,\r\n      interpersonal communication etc.) (3). Impedance on basic functioning secondary to visual\r\n      impairment can lead to loss of independence, low self-esteem or depression (3). When\r\n      pharmacological or surgical interventions prove futile in advanced vision loss, low vision\r\n      rehabilitation may be the only option for regaining lost function in patients. The goal of\r\n      low vision rehabilitation is to not restore lost vision but rather utilize the remaining\r\n      vision to its fullest potential thus enabling patients to reclaim their ADL and thereby their\r\n      independence.\r\n\r\n      Our study is based on the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Intervention Trial (LOVIT), a\r\n      randomized controlled trial conducted by Stelmack et al (4-6). Their goal was to evaluate the\r\n      efficacy of an outpatient low vision rehabilitation program for patients with moderate to\r\n      severe vision loss secondary to age related macular degeneration (ARMD). Their intervention\r\n      was effective in improving all aspects of visual function when compared with the control\r\n      group. There is very little evidence to support the use of low vision rehabilitation in\r\n      patients with chronic, irreversible visual loss secondary to glaucoma, and currently no\r\n      randomized trials have been done. Because the pattern of visual loss is different in ARMD and\r\n      glaucoma, it is not possible to extrapolate the ARMD data beyond the ARMD cohort. Yet, the\r\n      ARMD experience has established a proof of principal that can be used in the glaucoma\r\n      protocol design In patients with advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy, functional loss\r\n      often begins with mobility and difficulty ambulating (7). In one study, patients with visual\r\n      field loss secondary to their glaucoma showed a diminished traffic gap judgement when\r\n      crossing the street, which lead to an increased risk of harm. As a whole, the group made 23%\r\n      more errors in identifying a gap as crossable when it was too short to be made safely (7).\r\n      Another researcher found that 25% of patients with visual field loss in both eyes reported a\r\n      moderate to severe restriction in their mobility activities overall. In another study, field\r\n      loss secondary to glaucoma lead to a lower vision-related quality of life score. When\r\n      examined collectively, these reports and others suggest that those with reduced visual fields\r\n      and glaucoma experience more falls, more motor vehicle accidents, greater overall difficulty\r\n      with mobility activities and an overall decreased quality of living (7). Visual acuity can\r\n      vary over a wide range among patients with moderate to severe glaucoma, but overall, central\r\n      vision reduction occurs late in the disease. Some studies do show mild central and diffuse\r\n      reduction in fields in the early stages of glaucoma. As the visual fields and visual acuity\r\n      decline, patients often note difficulty with glare sensitivity, leaving response times to\r\n      light and dark adaptations hindered. In summary, the problems most often experienced by\r\n      patients with advanced glaucoma are related to ambulation, reading, distance spotting and\r\n      glare. Low vision rehabilitation aims to maximize independence in patients' daily lives by\r\n      addressing these difficulties.\r\n\r\n      It would be difficult to argue that low vision aids and rehabilitation in patients with\r\n      visual loss do not have a positive impact on both patients and their families; however there\r\n      exists little in the way of randomized controlled clinical trials which evaluate efficacy of\r\n      outpatient low vision rehabilitation and interdisciplinary strategies to deliver such\r\n      services. Given the existing shortage of inpatient resources and the staff required to manage\r\n      such patients, an outpatient program could deemed more cost effective and practical in our\r\n      limited health care system. Moreover, most available data on the subject focuses on\r\n      rehabilitation in patients with ARMD. There is very little to support the use of low vision\r\n      rehabilitation in patients with chronic, irreversible visual loss secondary to glaucoma. As\r\n      our population ages, we can expect with certainty an increase in the prevalence of visual\r\n      loss secondary to glaucoma, beginning in the next ten years (12). An evaluation of the\r\n      efficacy of strategies to address 'untreatable' vision loss, such as those patients with 'end\r\n      of the line' glaucoma, would be of great significance as we see glaucoma and its devastating\r\n      effects on vision and subsequently on quality of life increase greatly in the near future.\r\n      Evidence based models of outpatient low vision rehabilitation programs are needed to support\r\n      the implementation and delivery of such services for patients suffering from moderate to\r\n      severe glaucoma, and its devastating impact on daily functioning.\r\n\r\n      References\r\n\r\n        1.

However, there is ongoing research looking at\r\n      another modifiable risk factor that affects the development and progression of this disease.\r\n      There is growing evidence that vascular dysfunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of\r\n      glaucoma. Low ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), which is expressed as the difference between\r\n      mean arterial pressure and intraocular pressure (IOP), has been hypothesized to lead to\r\n      glaucomatous optic neuropathy via ischemic damage to the optic nerve. The Barbados Eye Study\r\n      showed that reduced OPP at baseline was associated with a three-fold increased risk of\r\n      glaucoma development. Evidence has also shown that optic nerve hypoperfusion may contribute\r\n      to the progression of glaucoma.\r\n\r\n      Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoacease) is a tree species that has been used in traditional medicine for\r\n      several hundred years to treat various diseases. There have been recent studies that have\r\n      examined its medicinal properties in treating age-related cognitive disease and neuronal\r\n      degeneration resulting from ischaemic events. Studies examining systemic vascular ischemic\r\n      diseases have shown a beneficial effect of ginkgo Biloba extract (GBE) on systemic arterial\r\n      occlusive diseases. There is also preliminary research examining the effect GBE has on optic\r\n      nerve head perfusion in patients with glaucoma. There is a study that examined the effects of\r\n      antioxidants including GBE on ocular blood flow in patients with glaucoma using doppler\r\n      ultrasound. When compared with patients receiving placebo, patients after antioxidant therapy\r\n      containing GBE were shown to have increased peak systolic and/or end-diastolic blood\r\n      velocities in all retrobulbar blood vessels, reduced vascular resistance in the central\r\n      retinal and nasal short posterior ciliary arteries, increased superior and inferior temporal\r\n      retinal capillary mean blood flow, an increased ratio of active to nonactive retinal\r\n      capillaries. In the area of optic nerve head perfusion studies, fluorescein angiography has\r\n      also been used in investigating alteration in blood flow in glaucomatous versus normal eyes.\r\n      However, utility in clinical practice is limited by the qualitative nature of the test and\r\n      the risk for adverse events. While color Doppler ultrasound is greatly limited in terms of\r\n      resolution and can be openly used to examine large vessels of the eye. New development in\r\n      ocular imaging has shown that OCTA can provide reproducible and quantifiable information\r\n      about the microvasculature of the optic nerve and peripapillary retina in patients with\r\n      glaucoma and can do so in a rapid and non-invasive manner avoiding some of the limitations on\r\n      doppler ultrasound and fluorescein angiography.\r\n\r\n      GBE Egb761 is a standardized GBE that's used in most published research on the effect of\r\n      ginkgo Biloba. It is a standardized GBE used in evidence-based medicine and clinical\r\n      investigations ensuring clinical standardization and a safe manufacturing process. It has\r\n      much of the toxic ginkgolic acid removed leaving behind the active components of flavonoid\r\n      glycosides and terpene lactones. In general, GBE is well tolerated with a low side effect\r\n      profile. Several systematic reviews on research using GBE (daily dose of up to 600 mg) report\r\n      no statistical difference in side effects with GBE compared with placebo. There have been\r\n      some concerns regarding the bleeding risk while on ginkgo supplementation. However,\r\n      randomized placebo-controlled studies in healthy volunteers have not shown any changes in\r\n      bleeding time, coagulation parameters, or platelet function. Multiple studies have reported\r\n      minimal adverse effects (AEs) of GBE within a specific prescribed dosage range. Overall, GBE\r\n      continues to be a well-tolerated supplement with a low side effect profile. Systematic\r\n      reviews of the Cochrane databases, PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar, report no\r\n      statistically significant difference in AEs between 80 and 600 mg of GBE and placebo.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT00698438", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["open-angle_glaucoma", "cataract"], "exclusion": ["glaucoma", "primary_open-angle_glaucoma", "uveitis", "ocular_abnormality"], "brief_title": "Comparison Of Trabeculectomy Versus The Ex-PRESS Miniature Glaucoma Device In The Same Patient: A Prospective Randomized Study", "brief_summary": "\n      the purpose of this study was to compare standard trabeculectomy to the Ex-PRESS mini\r\n      glaucoma shunt implantation under a scleral flap in eyes with open-angle glaucoma.In this\r\n      report, we describe the results of a prospective, randomized trial in which subjects with\r\n      bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma underwent the two procedures in fellow eyes.Design:\r\n      Prospective, randomized clinical trial.\r\n\r\n      Participants: 15 subjects with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma Methods: Subjects\r\n      underwent the two procedures in fellow eyes.

Microincisional glaucoma surgery (MIGS) have become more popular in recent years as\r\n      less invasive methods than traditional surgeries that effectively reduce IOP and help reduce\r\n      the medication burden on patients.There are multiple available MIGS procedures, most of which\r\n      act by increasing trabecular outflow.

Therefore the aim of this study is to investigate whether vitreopapillary\r\n      traction has a significant effect on diagnosis and follow up of glaucoma patients.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": "\n      The vitreous body fills the posterior chamber of the eye and consists mainly of water. It is\r\n      kept organized into a gel like structure by numerous collagen fibrils and makes contact with\r\n      the surrounding retina. This interplay known as the vitreo-retinal interface of the human eye\r\n      is a complex organization of bridging molecules anchoring the vitreous to the internal\r\n      limiting membrane. With ageing, the vitreous gel undergoes liquefaction accompanied by\r\n      progressive weakening of the adhesions at the vitreo-retinal interface resulting in a\r\n      stepwise process of adhesion release. Since the most firm attachments in the posterior pole\r\n      are situated at the macular and papillary region, tractional forces exerted during vitreous\r\n      separation could influence retinal functioning.\r\n\r\n      Up until now researchers have been looking primarily at the influence of vitreous traction to\r\n      the macular region of the nerve fiber layer.This research has led to the insight that\r\n      vitreo-macular traction can result in macular hole formation, and that patients with this\r\n      condition may benefit from vitreolysis induced by surgery (vitrectomy) or intravitreal\r\n      injection of ocriplasmin.\r\n\r\n      More recent reports have focused on the influence of the vitreous on the morphology of the\r\n      optic disc, showing that VPT altered optic disc architecture, increased average and temporal\r\n      retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and was associated with more pronounced visual field\r\n      defects. This could be important as very sensitive scans and diagnostic algorithms were\r\n      developed for staging and follow up of glaucoma patients' optic nerve head, which could be\r\n      influenced by the patients' vitreopapillar interface. As the status of this interface changes\r\n      over time, this could lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the optic disc diagnostic\r\n      scans.\r\n\r\n      Besides the diagnostic challenges induced by the vitreopapillar interaction, this interface\r\n      may also be of pathogenetic relevance in glaucoma. Indeed, the optic disc represents the\r\n      collection of all ganglion cell axons, and glaucoma is caused by a degeneration of ganglion\r\n      cells. Some authors have already suggested that vitreopapillary traction (VPT) could play a\r\n      role in the pathogenesis of optic nerve head hemorrhages, which are regarded as an important\r\n      risk factor for glaucoma progression. Moreover, one could hypothesize that VPT can cause\r\n      stress to the ganglion cell axons and therefore contribute more directly to ganglion cell\r\n      degeneration.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, this study aims at investigating the effect of VPT on the ultra-structural level\r\n      of the optic disc. A possible structure-function relation will be investigated with the help\r\n      of central visual field tests and focal retinal nerve fiber layer thickness assessment. With\r\n      increasing knowledge and imaging of VPT, possibly a VPT-staging algorithm can be developed\r\n      and VPT risk factors defined. Finally, this project may have a therapeutic impact, since it\r\n      will shed light on the question whether (surgically or chemically) induced vitreolysis might\r\n      be beneficial in some glaucoma patients with VPT.\r\n    "},{"nct_id": "NCT03904381", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": null, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["primary_open_angle_glaucoma"], "exclusion": ["angle_closure_glaucoma", "secondary_open_angle_glaucoma", "glaucoma", "conjunctival_pathologies", "pterygium", "inflammation", "blepharitis", "conjunctivitis", "keratitis", "uveitis", "silicone", "impaired_episcleral_venous_drainage", "sturge-weber", "nanophthalmos", "elevated_venous_pressure", "allergy", "glutaraldehyde", "keloid"], "brief_title": "Efficacy and Safety of XEN\u00ae Gel Stent and Post-operative Management in Patients With Open Angle Glaucoma", "brief_summary": "\n      To evaluate the efficacy of postoperative management with 5-fluorouracil injections after XEN\r\n      Gel Stent implantation.\r\n    ", "detailed_description": ""},{"nct_id": "NCT00533962", "minimum_age": 18.0, "maximium_age": 80.0, "gender": "A", "inclusion": ["glaucoma"], "exclusion": [], "brief_title": "IOP Reduction After Anecortave Acetate Injection in Glaucoma Patients", "brief_summary": "\n      Introduction: Ocular administration of glucocorticoids is a common and effective treatment\r\n      for several ocular diseases.

Recent automated perimetry\r\n      results (Humphrey visual field)\r\n\r\n      Research Study Visit 1 (within 2 months of clinic visit from which clinical data is\r\n      obtained):\r\n\r\n        1. Humphrey standard automated perimetry (visual field testing). This is a form of static\r\n           perimetry used to assess retinal function and sensitivity. It is a commonly used\r\n           photopic testing modality for the diagnosis and status of glaucoma and used frequently\r\n           throughout ophthalmology and many ophthalmologic clinical studies. We hypothesize that\r\n           there will be similarities in performance between Humphrey automated perimetry and OKR\r\n           testing which will help validate our testing strategy. For patients with glaucoma, for\r\n           whom visual field testing is frequently performed, this test will not be performed if a\r\n           high-quality visual field test has been obtained within the last 6 months.

OKR-based contrast testing. This will be performed as in the second visit described\r\n           above except that the testing order will be the right eye first, followed by the left\r\n           eye.\r\n\r\n        3. Debriefing. Subjective assessments of the testing modality and dark adaptation process\r\n           will be collected.\r\n\r\n      This visit should take approximately 90 minutes to complete.\r\n\r\n      For those participating in Study 2, participants will be asked if they will allow the study\r\n      staff to review their medical records to track clinical outcomes for 5 years. Participants\r\n      will be asked to allow review of their medical records related to their developing or not\r\n      developing glaucoma or other eye conditions to collect longitudinal data.

Patients suffering from refractory and advanced glaucoma with impaired\r\n      visual field who are not good candidates for surgery, cadenced subcleral transscleral\r\n      cyclophotocoagulation (CPCTSI) is commonly used to reduce IOP. The CPCTSI consists in\r\n      delivering short bursts of energy (in cycle) to the ciliary body, thus reducing production of\r\n      aqueous humor. The energy gusts develop sequentially to a photocoagulating state in the\r\n      pigmented epithelium. They are spaced by rest periods that allow surrounding tissue to cool\r\n      down and remain below photocoagulative threshold, thus avoiding damage to surrounding tissue.\r\n      Some studies have shown that the risk of complications increases with higher energies.\r\n      Complications associated with CPCTSI include prolonged intraocular inflammation, pain,\r\n      intraocular hemorrhage, hypotonia, phthysis, decreased vision and sympathetic ophthalmia.\r\n      Severity of these complications depends on collateral damage inflicted on surrounding\r\n      tissues: ciliary muscles, unpigmented epithelium and stroma of ciliary body.
